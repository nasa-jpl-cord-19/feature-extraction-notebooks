      "Error parsing: Abstract Canine respiratory diseases are commonly seen in dogs along with co-infections with multiple respiratory pathogens, including viruses and bacteria. Virus infections in even vaccinated dogs were also reported. The clinical signs caused by different respiratory etiological agents are similar, which makes differential diagnosis imperative. An oligonucleotide microarray system was developed in this study. The wild type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV), influenza virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV), Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos were detected and differentiated simultaneously on a microarray chip. The detection limit is 10, 10, 100, 50 and 50 copy numbers for CDV, influenza virus, CHV, B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos, respectively. The clinical test results of nasal swab samples showed that the microarray had remarkably better efficacy than the multiplex PCR-agarose gel method. The positive detection rate of microarray and agarose gel was 59.0% (n=33) and 41.1% (n=23) among the 56 samples, respectively. CDV vaccine strain and pathogen co-infections were further demonstrated by the microarray but not by the multiplex PCR-agarose gel. The oligonucleotide microarray provides a highly efficient diagnosis alternative that could be applied to clinical usage, greatly assisting in disease therapy and control.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalitis was used to evaluate recruitment, functional activation, and retention of peripheral bystander memory CD8(+) T cells. Mice were first infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing a non-cross-reactive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitope, designated p18. Following establishment of an endogenous p18-specific memory CD8(+) T-cell population, mice were challenged with coronavirus to directly compare recruitment, longevity, and activation characteristics of both primary coronavirus-specific and bystander memory populations trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). HIV-specific memory CD8(+) T cells were recruited early into the CNS as components of the innate immune response, preceding CD8(+) T cells specific for the dominant coronavirus epitope, designated pN. Although pN-specific T-cell numbers gradually exceeded bystander p18-specific CD8(+) T-cell numbers, both populations peaked concurrently within the CNS. Nevertheless, coronavirus-specific CD8(+) T cells were preferentially retained. By contrast, bystander CD8(+) T-cell numbers declined to background numbers following control of CNS virus replication. Furthermore, in contrast to highly activated pN-specific CD8(+) T cells, bystander p18-specific CD8(+) T cells recruited to the site of inflammation maintained a nonactivated memory phenotype and did not express ex vivo cytolytic activity. Therefore, analysis of host CD8(+) T-cell responses to unrelated infections demonstrates that bystander memory CD8(+) T cells can comprise a significant proportion of CNS inflammatory cells during virus-induced encephalitis. However, transient CNS retention and the absence of activation suggest that memory bystander CD8(+) T cells may not overtly contribute to pathology in the absence of antigen recognition.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary Much controversy still exists about the role of viruses, bacteria and fungi in nasal sinus diseases. Viral rhinitis alone does not seem to be able to elicit clinical acute sinusitis. Bacteria determine the clinical picture and outcome of sinusitis. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are the bacteria most frequently involved. Much more conflicting reports are published about normal sinus flora, the role of anaerobes and the microbiology of chronic sinusitis. The relationship between infectious and allergic diseases ise more difficult to explain. It is shown that, in particular viruses can induce the release of inflammatory mediators and modify the inflammatory process. Their role in epithelial damage, excitation of nerve fibers, sensitization of inflammatory cells, and therefore, in general hyperreactivity has also been reported. Finally, with regard to sinusitis, different hypothesis have been proposed to explain the possible links with bronchial hyperreactivity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the \\\"conservative transitions\\\" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Caspase-6 activation occurs early in Alzheimer disease and sometimes precedes the clinical manifestation of the disease in aged individuals. The active Caspase-6 is localized in neuritic plaques, in neuropil threads, and in neurofibrillary tangles containing neurons that are not morphologically apoptotic in nature. To investigate the potential consequences of the activation of Caspase-6 in neurons, we conducted a proteomics analysis of Caspase-6-mediated cleavage of human neuronal proteins. Proteins from the cytosolic and membrane subcellular compartments were treated with recombinant active Caspase-6 and compared with undigested proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. LC/MS/MS analyses of the proteins that were cleaved identified 24 different potential protein substrates. Of these, 40% were cytoskeleton or cytoskeleton-associated proteins. We focused on the cytoskeleton proteins because these are critical for neuronal structure and function. Caspase-6 cleavage of α-Tubulin, α-Actinin-4, Spinophilin, and Drebrin was confirmed. At least one Caspase-6 cleavage site was identified for Drebrin, Spinophilin, and α-Tubulin. A neoepitope antiserum to α-Tubulin cleaved by Caspase-6 immunostained neurons, neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease and co-localized with active Caspase-6. These results imply that the early and neuritic activation of Caspase-6 in Alzheimer disease could disrupt the cytoskeleton network of neurons, resulting in impaired neuronal structure and function in the absence of cell death. This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion-venom-peptide-derived mucroporin-M1 for three RNA viruses (measles viruses, SARS-CoV, and H5N1). In this investigation, a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti-HIV activities. A new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as the most potent anti-HIV-1 peptide by screening assays with an EC(50) value of 2.76 µg/ml (1.65 µM) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index (SI) of 13.93. Kn2-7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped virus (PV) with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic NL4-3 PV strain. Furthermore, it also inhibited a CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV-1 subtype B virus. Binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV by Octet Red system suggested the anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 envelope. These results demonstrated that peptide Kn2-7 could inhibit HIV-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against HIV-1.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing. It remains a treasure capable of generating unexpected insights.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract JHM virus (JHMV) and A59 virus (A59V) are neurotropic members of the hepatoencephalitis group of murine coronaviridae. JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5°. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40–100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose. Denaturation of the virus-specific RNA with heat and dimethylsulfoxide does not appreciably alter the sedimentation profiles of either the presumptive virion RNA or mRNA species.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Viruses are excellent vehicles for gene therapy due to their natural ability to infect and deliver the cargo to specific tissues with high efficiency. Although such vectors are usually “gutted” and are replication defective, they are subjected to clearance by the host cells by immune recognition and destruction. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a naturally evolved cyto-protective signaling pathway which is triggered due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in its lumen. The UPR signaling consists of three signaling pathways, namely PKR-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring protein-1. Once activated, UPR triggers the production of ER molecular chaperones and stress response proteins to help reduce the protein load within the ER. This occurs by degradation of the misfolded proteins and ensues in the arrest of protein translation machinery. If the burden of protein load in ER is beyond its processing capacity, UPR can activate pro-apoptotic pathways or autophagy leading to cell death. Viruses are naturally evolved in hijacking the host cellular translation machinery to generate a large amount of proteins. This phenomenon disrupts ER homeostasis and leads to ER stress. Alternatively, in the case of gutted vectors used in gene therapy, the excess load of recombinant vectors administered and encountered by the cell can trigger UPR. Thus, in the context of gene therapy, UPR becomes a major roadblock that can potentially trigger inflammatory responses against the vectors and reduce the efficiency of gene transfer.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The pathogenic mechanism by which parvovirus B19 may induce inflammatory cardiomyopathy (iCMP) is complex but is known to involve inflammatory processes, possibly including activation of JAK/STAT signaling. The nonstructural B19 protein NS1 acts as a transactivator triggering signaling cascades that eventually lead to activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We examined the impact of NS1 on modulation of STAT signaling in human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The NS1 sequences were identified from B19 DNA isolated from the myocardia of patients with fatal iCMP. B19 infection as well as NS1 overexpression in HMEC-1 cells produced a significant upregulation in the phosphorylation of both tyrosine(705) and serine(727) STAT3 (P < 0.05). The increased STAT3 phosphorylation was accompanied by dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of pSTAT3. In contrast, NS1 expression did not result in increased STAT1 activation. Notably, the expression levels of the negative regulators of STAT activation, SOCS1 and SOCS3, were not altered by NS1. However, the level of PIAS3 was upregulated in NS1-expressing HMEC-1 cells. Analysis of the transcriptional activation of target genes revealed that NS1-induced STAT3 signaling was associated with upregulation of genes involved in immune response (e.g., the IFNAR1 and IL-2 genes) and downregulation of genes associated with viral defense (e.g., the OAS1 and TYK2 genes). Our results demonstrate that B19 NS1 modulates the STAT/PIAS pathway. The NS1-induced upregulation of STAT3/PIAS3 in the absence of STAT1 phosphorylation and the lack of SOCS1/SOCS3 activation may contribute to the mechanisms by which B19 evades the immune response and establishes persistent infection in human endothelial cells. Thus, NS1 may play a critical role in the mechanism of viral pathogenesis in B19-associated iCMP.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In this study, we observed that LT markedly increased the circulating soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) levels and microparticle (MP) count in wild-type but not P-selectin (P-sel, Selp(−/−)) or P-sel ligand-1 (PSGL-1, Selplg(−/−)) knockout mice. Because sP-sel induces a hypercoagulable state through PSGL-1 pathway to generate tissue factor-positive MPs, we hypothesized that the increase in plasma sP-sel levels can be a self-rescue response in hosts against the LT-mediated suppression of the coagulation system. In agreement with our hypothesis, our results indicated that compared with wild-type mice, Selp(−/−) and Selplg(−/−) mice were more sensitive to LT. In addition, the recombinant sP-sel treatment markedly ameliorated LT-mediated pathogenesis and reduced mortality. As a result, elicitation of circulating sP-sel is potentially a self-rescue response, which is beneficial to host recovery from an LT-induced hypocoagulation state. These results suggest that the administration of sP-sel is likely to be useful in the development of a new strategy to treat anthrax.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined. No case fatality has been reported in children and the short- to medium-term outcome appears to be good.

The extent to which health care workers and institutions use these CDC recommended practices is uncertain. Methods The study examined health care worker adherence to CDC recommended respiratory infection control practices in primary care clinics and emergency departments of 5 medical centers in King County, Washington, using a self-administered questionnaire. All clinical, allied, and administrative health care workers in study settings were invited to participate: 653 (53%) responded, and 630 were included. Results The survey revealed important shortcomings in overall personal and institutional use of CDC recommended practices, including deficiencies in posted alerts, patient masking and separation, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, staff training, and written procedures. Use of recommended measures was generally higher among nursing staff than medical practitioners. Conclusion This study found significant gaps in adherence to CDC recommendations for the control of respiratory infections in ambulatory care clinical settings.

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause recurrent and severe respiratory tract infections. Cytoskeletal proteins are often involved during viral infections, either for cell entry or the initiation of the immune response. The importance of actin and clathrin dynamics for cell entry and the initiation of the cellular immune response against RSV in human immune cells is not known yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry of RSV and the subsequent effect on T cell activation and interferon gamma release in human immune cells. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes were isolated from healthy adults and stimulated in vitro with RSV. Actin and clathrin dynamics were inhibited with respectively cytochalasin D and chlorpromazine. T cell receptor signaling was inhibited with cyclosporin A. Flow cytometry was used to determine the role of actin and clathrin on cell entry and T cell activation by RSV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the contribution of actin and clathrin on the release of interferon gamma. RESULTS: Cell entry, virus gene transcription and interferon gamma release are actin-dependent. Post-endocytic processes like the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II on monocytes , T cell activation and the release of interferon gamma are clathrin-dependent. Finally, T cell receptor signaling affects T cell activation, whereas soluble interleukin 18 is dispensable. CONCLUSION: Analysis of cell entry and interferon gamma release after infection with RSV reveals the importance of actin- and clathrin-dependent signaling in human immune cells. Insights into the cellular biology of the human immune response against respiratory syncytial virus will provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may prove useful in the development of preventive strategies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Influenza virus contains three integral membrane proteins: haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein (M1 and M2). Among them, M2 protein functions as an ion channel, important for virus uncoating in endosomes of virus-infected cells and essential for virus replication. In an effort to explore potential new functions of M2 in the virus life cycle, we used yeast two-hybrid system to search for M2-associated cellular proteins. One of the positive clones was identified as human Hsp40/Hdj1, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein. Here, we report that both BM2 (M2 of influenza B virus) and A/M2 (M2 of influenza A virus) interacted with Hsp40 in vitro and in vivo. The region of M2-Hsp40 interaction has been mapped to the CTD1 domain of Hsp40. Hsp40 has been reported to be a regulator of PKR signaling pathway by interacting with p58(IPK) that is a cellular inhibitor of PKR. PKR is a crucial component of the host defense response against virus infection. We therefore attempted to understand the relationship among M2, Hsp40 and p58(IPK) by further experimentation. The results demonstrated that both A/M2 and BM2 are able to bind to p58(IPK)in vitro and in vivo and enhance PKR autophosphorylation probably via forming a stable complex with Hsp40 and P58(IPK), and consequently induce cell death. These results suggest that influenza virus M2 protein is involved in p58(IPK) mediated PKR regulation during influenza virus infection, therefore affecting infected-cell life cycle and virus replication.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The upstream pseudoknots domain (UPD) of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is located at the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). It plays an important role in virus replication and translation. To determine the importance of UPD and 3′-UTR, and the effects of introduced RNA elements in TMV 3′-UTR, a series of TMV mutants with internal poly(A) tract upstream of UPD was constructed for structural analysis by selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). TMV(24A+UPD) and TMV(42A+UPD) formed a similar structure as that of TMV 3′-UTR, but TMV(62A+UPD) structures altered by the introduced poly(A) tract. In addition, TMV(24A+UPD) had a higher viral RNAs accumulation than TMV in N. benthamiana protoplasts, and induced lethal symptoms in the infected plants. TMV(62A+UPD) showed a drastically reduced accumulation, its coat protein was undetectable in protoplasts, and the inoculated plants remained symptomless. This study analyzed the structures of 3′-UTR of TMV and found that the longer poly(A) tract introduced upstream of UPD reduced viral RNAs accumulation and induced milder symptoms in N. benthamiana. In conclusion, different lengths of the internal poly(A) tract introduced into the TMV 3′UTR lead to structural variations that affect virus accumulation and symptom expression.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: This study investigated healthcare workers’ perceptions of hand hygiene practices by comparing personal reports, as assessed by questionnaires, to direct observations of the workers’ hand hygiene practices. The study employed a cross-sectional research design. Observations were made using a 16-item checklist, based on three sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and Boyce and Pittet’s guidelines of hand hygiene. The checklist was used for both direct-observation and self-reported data collection purposes. Pearson correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) were utilized to statistically determine the relationship between healthcare workers’ reports of hand hygiene practices and observed hand hygiene behaviors. The study was conducted in the outpatient examination rooms and emergency departments of three types of hospitals in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic and is observed in routine cases and outbreaks. The total sample size included 87 physicians and nurses recruited while on duty during the scheduled observation periods, with each healthcare worker being observed during individual medical examinations with at least three patients. No statistically significant correlations between the healthcare workers’ perceptions of hand hygiene practices and healthcare workers’ actual behaviors were evident. Based on the self-report questionnaires, significant differences were found between physicians’ and nurses’ hand hygiene practices reports. Healthcare workers clearly understand the importance of careful hand hygiene practices, but based on researchers’ observations, the medical personnel failed to properly implement protocol-driven hand hygiene applications. However, the significant differences between physicians’ and nurses’ self-reports suggest further inquiry is needed to fully explore these discrepancies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Coronaviruses encode a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility for common targets for attenuation and therapeutic design. In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting.\\n\\nSignificanceCoronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses for attenuation. With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-coronavirus functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2O MTase function across coronaviruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary This chapter describes the application of nano- and micro-electromechanical systems (NEMs and MEMs), and more specifically microcantilever structures, as transducers for highly sensitive biosensors. In these devices, named as ‘nanomechanical biosensors,’ a biomolecular interaction produces a change in the mechanical behavior of the transducer (a movement at nanometer scale), which can be measured and analyzed in real time. Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. This chapter discusses the main aspects regarding the physics of microcantilever as well the optical read-out techniques. It reviews the state-of-the-art, and discusses the prospective future directions of this new family of biosensors. Nanomechanical sensors are derived from the microfabricated cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are based on the bending or resonance change induced in the cantilever when a biomolecular interaction takes place on one of its surfaces. The cantilever response depends on its mechanical properties, which are determined mainly by their spring constant and resonance frequency. Both parameters depend on the cantilever material and its geometry. The increasing number of applications of microcantilevers as biosensors has established these systems as a versatile platform for real-time and in situmeasurements of physical, chemical, and biochemical interactions. Further research is banked upon to provide information for increasing the biosensor sensitivity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary Our aim was to evaluate the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique for the detection of rotavirus shedding by infected children as a routine diagnostic procedure, in comparison to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double stranded RNA. Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10–20% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3′ and 5′ ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the search for rotavirus in different clinical specimens (sera, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, etc.) and in environmental samples, as well as the typing of viral strains using serotype-specific primers.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract To estimate the fraction of the exhaled airflow that is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing, experiments were carried out in a water tank with an anatomically accurate respiratory tract model of a 4-year-old child. The velocity of respiratory flow was scaled using similarity laws between air and water. Breath simulation was performed via a computer-controlled piston-cylinder system. Food-dye visualization allows a qualitative analysis of the re-inhaled fraction of this exhaled flow. For the quantitative analysis, neutrally buoyant particles were added to the water medium, and illuminated by the laser which illuminates the whole breathing region of the respiratory model, such that the trajectory and quantity of the re-inhaled particles can be recorded and counted. The experimental results in the pediatric airway replica show that a negligible fraction (<0.06%) of the exhaled airflow is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing in the absence of the rising thermal plume. The artificial plume generated by a heated aluminium brick at the tank bottom increases the re-inhalation ratio by 4 times under the investigated case (albeit still at a very low value of 0.15%). Our results thus reveal that during normal nasal breathing in the present pediatric subject, the vast majority of human exhaled airflow escapes from the inhalation zone and is not re-inhaled.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The effect was maximal at 1 week after infection, and thymuses returned to normal size by 2 weeks after infection. There was no effect of glucocorticoids, since thymus atrophy was also found in adrenalectomized, infected mice. In infected thymus, immature CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes were selectively depleted, and apoptosis of lymphocytes was increased. The MHV receptor glycoprotein MHVR was detected on thymus epithelial cells but not on T lymphocytes. In a small number of stromal epithelial cells, but in very few lymphocytes, the viral genome was detectable by in situ hybridization. These observations suggested that MHV-A59-induced thymic atrophy results not from a generalized lytic infection of T lymphocytes but rather from apoptosis of immature double-positive T cells that might be caused by infection of a small proportion of thymus epithelial cells or from inappropriate secretion of some factor, such as a cytokine.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: ABSTRACT Quasispecies theory is providing a solid, evolving conceptual framework for insights into virus population dynamics, adaptive potential, and response to lethal mutagenesis. The complexity of mutant spectra can influence disease progression and viral pathogenesis, as demonstrated using virus variants selected for increased replicative fidelity. Complementation and interference exerted among components of a viral quasispecies can either reinforce or limit the replicative capacity and disease potential of the ensemble. In particular, a progressive enrichment of a replicating mutant spectrum with interfering mutant genomes prompted by enhanced mutagenesis may be a key event in the sharp transition of virus populations into error catastrophe that leads to virus extinction. Fitness variations are influenced by the passage regimes to which viral populations are subjected, notably average fitness decreases upon repeated bottleneck events and fitness gains upon competitive optimization of large viral populations. Evolving viral quasispecies respond to selective constraints by replication of subpopulations of variant genomes that display higher fitness than the parental population in the presence of the selective constraint. This has been profusely documented with fitness effects of mutations associated with resistance of pathogenic viruses to antiviral agents. In particular, selection of HIV-1 mutants resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral inhibitors, and the compensatory effect of mutations in the same genome, offers a compendium of the molecular intricacies that a virus can exploit for its survival. This chapter reviews the basic principles of quasispecies dynamics as they can serve to explain the behavior of viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: The deadliest Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen is currently ravaging West Africa, despite the concerted efforts of the World Health Organization and many national governments. The current picture is troubling, but not altogether unexpected. Ebola was initially identified in 1976, and since that time, few drugs have been developed to combat it. The same is true for myriad other dangerous infectious diseases to which the world is currently susceptible. One proposal that might prevent outbreaks of this scale and magnitude from recurring would be to have the World Health Organization (WHO) and its technical partners assess which of its member states are at high risk for a disease, either directly or indirectly, and facilitate the creation of international governmental risk pools of those member states. Risk pools would offer open-indexed grant contracts to fund vaccine and drug development for a particular disease, and pharmaceutical companies could browse the index to apply for these grants. If the risk-pool states and a particular company sign a contract, a mutually agreed upon amount of the vaccine or drug would be produced at a below-market purchase price for those states. In return, the company would keep any patents or intellectual property rights for the developed vaccines or drugs. Risk-pool countries that did not use their vaccine or drug could resell that supply on secondary markets to other countries outside of the risk pool. This arrangement will increase the supply of tested drug and vaccine candidates available for combatting unexpected outbreaks of any previously discovered major infectious disease in the future.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control. Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: It has recently been shown that cell entry of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2) is mediated through endocytosis (Z. Qiu et al., J. Virol. 80:5768-5776, 2006). However, the molecular mechanism underlying MHV-2 entry is not known. Here we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to determine the molecular pathways for MHV-2 entry. Our results showed that MHV-2 gene expression and infectivity were significantly inhibited when cells were treated with chemical and physiologic blockers of the clathrin-mediated pathway, such as chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose medium. Furthermore, viral gene expression was significantly inhibited when cells were transfected with a small interfering RNA specific to the clathrin heavy chain. However, these treatments did not affect the infectivity and gene expression of MHV-A59, demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitions. In addition, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of caveolin 1 did not have any effect on MHV-2 infection, while it significantly blocked the caveolin-dependent uptake of cholera toxin subunit B. These results demonstrate that MHV-2 utilizes the clathrin- but not caveolin-mediated endocytic pathway for entry. Interestingly, when the cells transiently overexpressed a dominant-negative form (DIII) of Eps15, which is thought to be an essential component of the clathrin pathway, viral gene expression and infectivity were unaffected, although DIII expression blocked transferrin uptake and vesicular stomatitis virus infection, which are dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, MHV-2 entry is mediated through clathrin-dependent but Eps15-independent endocytosis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The vector-borne flaviviruses cause severe disease in humans on every inhabited continent on earth. Their transmission by arthropods, particularly mosquitoes, facilitates large emergence events such as witnessed with Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus in the Americas. Every vector-borne flavivirus examined thus far that causes disease in humans, from dengue virus to ZIKV, antagonizes the host type I interferon (IFN-I) response by preventing JAK-STAT signaling, suggesting that suppression of this pathway is an important determinant of infection. The most direct and potent viral inhibitor of this pathway is the nonstructural protein NS5. However, the mechanisms utilized by NS5 from different flaviviruses are often quite different, sometimes despite close evolutionary relationships between viruses. The varied mechanisms of NS5 as an IFN-I antagonist are also surprising given that the evolution of NS5 is restrained by the requirement to maintain function of two enzymatic activities critical for virus replication, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This review discusses the different strategies used by flavivirus NS5 to evade the antiviral effects of IFN-I and how this information can be used to better model disease and develop antiviral countermeasures.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: “Atypical” pneumonia was described as a distinct and mild form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) already before Mycoplasma pneumoniae had been discovered and recognized as its cause. M. pneumoniae is detected in CAP patients most frequently among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age, with a decline after adolescence and tapering off in adulthood. Detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology in children with CAP admitted to the hospital amount 4–39%. Although the infection is generally mild and self-limiting, patients of every age can develop severe or extrapulmonary disease. Recent studies indicate that high rates of healthy children carry M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract and that current diagnostic PCR or serology cannot discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection and carriage. Further, symptoms and radiologic features are not specific for M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, patients may be unnecessarily treated with antimicrobials against M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics for this entity in children younger than 8 years of age. Overall macrolides are extensively used worldwide, and this has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, which may be associated with severe clinical features and more extrapulmonary complications. This review focuses on the characteristics of M. pneumoniae infections in children, and exemplifies that simple clinical decision rules may help identifying children at high risk for CAP due to M. pneumoniae. This may aid physicians in prescribing appropriate first-line antibiotics, since current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection are not reliably predictive.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Feline foamy virus (FFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) belong to the Retroviridae family. While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono- and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host. Our study supports the utility of cats naturally co-infected with retroviruses as a model to investigate the impact of FV on immunocompromised mammalian hosts.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Viruses regulate cellular signalling pathways to ensure optimal viral replication. During Marburg virus (MARV) infection, large quantities of the viral glycoprotein GP are produced in the ER; this may result in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The most conserved pathway to trigger UPR is initiated by IRE1. Activation of IRE1 results in auto-phosphorylation, splicing of the XBP1 mRNA and translation of the XBP1s protein. XBP1s binds cis-acting UPR elements (UPRE) which leads to the enhanced expression of genes which should restore ER homeostasis. XBP1u protein is translated, if IRE1 is not activated. Here we show that ectopic expression of MARV GP activated the IRE1-XBP1 axis of UPR as monitored by UPRE luciferase assays. However, while at 24 h of infection with MARV IRE1 was phosphorylated, expression of XBP1s was only slightly enhanced and UPRE activity was not detected. The IRE1-XBP1 axis was not active at 48 h p.i. Co-expression studies of MARV proteins demonstrated that the MARV protein VP30 suppressed UPRE activation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed an RNA-dependent interaction of VP30 with XBP1u. Knock-out of IRE1 supported MARV infection at late time points. Taken together, these results suggest that efficient MARV propagation requires specific regulation of IRE1 activity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Cellular kinases phosphorylate BCX4430 to a triphosphate that mimics ATP; viral RNA polymerases incorporate the drug's monophosphate nucleotide into the growing RNA chain, causing premature chain termination. BCX4430 is active in vitro against many RNA viral pathogens, including the filoviruses and emerging infectious agents such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In vivo, BCX4430 is active after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and oral administration in a variety of experimental infections. In nonclinical studies involving lethal infections with Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Yellow Fever virus, BCX4430 has demonstrated pronounced efficacy. In experiments conducted in several models, both a reduction in the viral load and an improvement in survival were found to be related to the dose of BCX4430.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Air quality has been an important issue in public health for many years. Sensing the level and distributions of impurities help in the control of building systems and mitigate long term health risks. Rapid detection of infectious diseases in large public areas like airports and train stations may help limit exposure and aid in reducing the spread of the disease. Complete coverage by sensors to account for any release scenario of chemical or biological warfare agents may provide the opportunity to develop isolation and evacuation plans that mitigate the impact of the attack. All these scenarios involve strategic placement of sensors to promptly detect and rapidly respond. This paper presents a data driven sensor placement algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach. The approach utilizes the finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius (PF) concept. The PF operator (or the Markov matrix) is used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporates sensor accuracy, location constraints, and sensing constraints. The algorithm determines the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed. The utility of the procedure is illustrated using four examples: a literature example of the flow field inside an aircraft cabin and three air flow fields in different geometries. The effect of the constraints on the response times for different sensor placement scenarios is investigated. Knowledge of the response time and coverage of the multiple sensors aides in the design of mechanical systems and response mechanisms. The methodology provides a simple process for place sensors in a building, analyze the sensor coverage maps and response time necessary during extreme events, as well as evaluate indoor air quality. The theory established in this paper also allows for future work in topics related to construction of classical estimator problems for the sensors, real-time contaminant transport, and development of agent dispersion, contaminant isolation/removal, and evacuation strategies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed left lower lobe pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion with a complex left pleural effusion. Ultrasound findings prompted the need for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest confirmed a large pleural effusion with major atelectasis and mediastinal shift. The patient was treated with empiric antibiotics, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) decortication of empyema, and chest tube placement.

A thoracentesis with culture failed to isolate a bacterial organism. Dexamethasone was started after repeat CXR showed persistent infiltrate. Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT of the chest showed a large collection of air and persistent consolidation. The patient received repeat VATS decortication and reinsertion of a chest tube.

      "Error parsing: Abstract A plaque mutant was isolated from Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/c cells persistently infected with a mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-S. While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques. Protease appears to play an important role in MHV-induced cell fusion in general.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Objectives This study tested the effect of Epimedium-derived phytoestrogen (PE) on preventing steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) in rabbit model. Methods Thirty 28-week-old male New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into control group (CON; n =14) and PE group (PE; n =16; 5 mg/kg body weight/day) after receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. Before and after inductive protocol, Dynamic-MRI was employed on bilateral femora for local intra-osseous perfusion, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid-transportation, and marrow samples were quantified for adipogenesis-gene mRNA expression. Six weeks later, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based micro-angiography, and then ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular fat-cell-size were examined histopathologically. Results The incidence of ON in the PE group (31%) was significantly lower than that in the CON group (93%). Compared to the CON group, local intra-osseous perfusion was maintained in the PE group. Blocked trunk vessels were seldom found in micro-angiography of the PE-treated rabbits. Thrombosis incidence and fat-cell-size were both significantly lower in the PE group than those in the CON group. During the early period after induction, indicator of coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation and adipogenesis-gene expression were found with significantly changing pattern in the PE group compared to the CON group. Conclusion PE was able to exert beneficial effect on preventing steroid-associated ON in rabbits with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The coronavirus (CoV) E protein plays an important role in virus assembly. The E protein is made in excess during infection and has been shown to have ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers. However, a role in infection for the unincorporated E or its ion channel activity has not been described. To further investigate the function of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein, we developed a recombinant version of IBV in which the E protein was replaced by a mutant containing a heterologous hydrophobic domain. The mutant virus, IBV-EG3, was defective in release of infectious virus particles. Further characterization of IBV-EG3 revealed that damaged particles appeared to accumulate intracellularly. The phenotype of IBV-EG3 suggested that the hydrophobic domain of IBV E may be important for the forward trafficking of cargo, so we determined whether IBV E facilitated the delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, we found that IBV E, but not EG3, dramatically reduced the delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane by impeding movement through the Golgi complex. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of IBV E, but not EG3, induced the disassembly of the Golgi complex. Finally, we determined that the delivery of IBV S to the plasma membrane was reduced in cells infected with wild-type-IBV compared to those infected with IBV-EG3. Our results indicated that the hydrophobic domain of IBV E alters the host secretory pathway to the apparent advantage of the virus.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of patients with ADEM who were admitted to the Pediatric Departments in Aladan and Alfarawanya Hospitals in Kuwait, from January 2009 to January 2011. Clinical, microbiological and radiological data were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 48 patients presented with acute neurological symptoms and signs, 21 patients fulfilled criteria for ADEM. 80.95% of cases were presenting in winter and spring, 57% of patients had a history of upper respiratory tract illness. The commonest presentations were motor deficits, convulsions and altered consciousness. CSF virology studies showed herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (3 patients) whereas nasal and nasopharyngeal swab showed evidence of influenza H1N1 virus (1 patient). Brain MRI was performed in all patients and revealed multiple hyperintense supratentorial brain lesions on T2/FLAIR images. 85.7% of patients had cortical and/or subcortical white matter lesions which were bilateral and asymmetric in location and size. CONCLUSION: ADEM although rare must be considered in children with acute onset of neurological signs and symptoms and must be distinguished from any acute neurological insult.: Msg: HTTPConnectionPool(host='tika.covid19data.space.internal', port=80): Read timed out.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses DOI: 10.1111/j.1750‐2659.2012.00340.x. Background Little is known about the prevalence of viral infections in children with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP). Objectives To describe the clinical and virological data collected from children with radiographically confirmed CAP in whom 17 respiratory viruses were sought in respiratory secretion samples during the acute phase of the disease. Patients and methods The study involved 592 children with radiographically confirmed CAP whose respiratory secretion samples were tested using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay, which simultaneously detects influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)‐A and ‐B, parainfluenzavirus‐1, ‐2, ‐3, and ‐4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and bocavirus. A real‐time PCR assay was used to identify the rhinovirus in the enterovirus/rhinovirus‐positive samples. Results A total of 435 children (73·5%) were positive for at least one virus: the most frequently detected was RSV, which was found in 188 (31·7%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 144, 24·3%), bocavirus (n = 60, 10·1%), influenza viruses (n = 57, 9·6), and hMPV (n = 49, 8·2%). Viral co‐infections were found in 117 children (19·7% of the enrolled children; 26·9% of those with viral infections). Marginal differences were found between the infections owing to a single virus. Co‐infections showed radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia significantly more frequently than single infections (OR 1·72, 95% CI 1·05–2·81). Conclusions The findings of this study highlight the importance of respiratory viruses (mainly RSV and rhinovirus) in children with CAP and show the characteristics of both the single infections and co‐infections associated with the disease.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Its S1 domain is responsible for receptor binding and SARS-CoV entry into cells. In this study, we constructed a rational 3D model for S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein by fold recognition and molecular modeling techniques. We found that there is a structure similarity between S1 protein and influenza virus neuraminidase. Our analyses suggest that the existing anti-influenza virus inhibitors and anti-neuraminidase antibody could be used as a starting point for designing anti-SARS drugs, vaccines and antibodies.

In this paper we take advantage of the unique architectural organization of neurons to investigate the localization of a spectrum of compartment-specific markers with the goal of defining the location of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), smooth ER, intermediate compartment, and the Golgi complex. Markers of the rough ER (signal sequence receptor), Golgi complex (mannosidase II), and the trans Golgi network (TGN38) were essentially restricted to the cell body and the initial segment of one of the cell's dendrites. In contrast the cytochemical reaction product for glucose 6 phosphate, a classical ER marker, in addition to staining ER structures in the cell body also reacted with smooth ER elements that extended into both axons and dendrites. These peripheral smooth ER elements also reacted at the immunofluorescence level for ER marker 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, as well as for calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase. We also analyzed the location of rab1, rab2, p58, the KDEL receptor, and beta-subunit of coatomer. These intermediate compartment markers were found predominantly in the cell body but also extended to the proximal parts of the dendrites. Collectively, our data argue that the ER of hippocampal neurons consists of functionally and spatially distinct and separated domains, and they stress the power of the hippocampal neuron system for investigations of the organization of the ER by light microscopy.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary In addition to its many other functions, the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells serves as a barrier against invading parasites and viruses. It is not permeable to ions and to low molecular weight solutes, let alone to proteins and polynucleotides. Yet it is clear that viruses are capable of transferring their genome and accessory proteins into the cytosol or into the nucleus, and thus infect the cell. While the detailed mechanisms remain unclear for most animal viruses, a general theme is apparent like other stages in the replication cycle; their entry depends on the activities of the host cell. In order to take up nutrients, to communicate with other cells, to control the intracellular ion balance, and to secrete substances, cells have a variety of mechanisms for bypassing and modifying the barrier properties imposed by their plasma membrane.

      "Error parsing: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated, highly lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Currently, no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available. Studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent FCoV isolates. Since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing FIP and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the feline IFN-γ gene (fIFNG) are associated with the outcome of infection. A total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 FIP cats were analyzed, and 16 SNP were identified in intron 1 of fIFNG. Among these SNP, the fFING + 428 T allele was shown to be a FIP-resistant allele (p = 0.03), and the heterozygous genotypes 01C/T and +408C/T were found to be FIP-susceptible factors (p = 0.004). Furthermore, an fIFNG + 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of IFN-γ in FIP cats. For the identification of these three FIP-related SNP, genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing. The identification of additional FIP-related SNP will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to FIP.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: T helper 1 driven immune responses facilitate host defence during viral infections. Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) mediates T helper 1 driven immune responses, and since mature IL-18 is up-regulated in human macrophages after influenza virus infection in vitro, it has been suggested that IL-18 plays an important role in the immune response to influenza. To determine the role of IL-18 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(–/–)) and normal wildtype mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus. Influenza resulted in an increase in constitutively expressed IL-18 in the lungs of wildtype mice. The clearance of influenza A was inhibited by IL-18, as indicated by reduced viral loads on day 8 and day 12 after infection in IL-18(–/–) mice. This enhanced viral clearance correlated with increased CD4(+) T-cell activation in the lungs as reflected by CD69 expression on the cell surface. Surprisingly, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were similar in the lungs of IL-18(–/–) mice and wildtype mice. Intracellular IFN-γ staining revealed similar expression levels in lung-derived natural killer cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, indicating that IFN-γ production is IL-18-independent during influenza virus infection. Tumour necrosis factor-α production by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in IL-18(–/–) mice than in wildtype mice. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-18 impairs viral clearance during influenza A infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: A common feature of infection by positive-sense RNA virus is the modification of host cell cytoplasmic membranes that serve as sites of viral RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), but the role of DMVs in replication and virus fitness remains unclear. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), three of which, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are necessary and sufficient for DMV formation. It has been shown previously that mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 loop 1 that alter nsp4 glycosylation are associated with disrupted DMV formation and result in changes in virus replication and RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether DMV morphology or another function of nsp4 glycosylation is responsible for effects on virus replication. In this study, we tested whether mutations across nsp4, both alone and in combination with mutations that abolish nsp4 glycosylation, affected DMV formation, replication, and fitness. Residues in nsp4 distinct from glycosylation sites, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal loop 1, independently disrupted both the number and morphology of DMVs and exacerbated DMV changes associated with loss of glycosylation. Mutations that altered DMV morphology but not glycosylation did not affect virus fitness while viruses lacking nsp4 glycosylation exhibited a loss in fitness. The results support the hypothesis that DMV morphology and numbers are not key determinants of virus fitness. The results also suggest that nsp4 glycosylation serves roles in replication in addition to the organization and stability of MHV-induced double-membrane vesicles. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense RNA viruses modify host cytoplasmic membranes for viral replication complex formation. Thus, defining the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane modifications is essential for both understanding virus replication and development of novel approaches to virus inhibition. Coronavirus-induced membrane changes include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes. Three viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are known to be required for DMV formation. It is unknown how these proteins induce membrane modification or which regions of the proteins are involved in DMV formation and stability. In this study, we show that mutations across nsp4 delay virus replication and disrupt DMV formation and that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial fitness cost. These results support a critical role for nsp4 in DMV formation and virus fitness.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary Despite advances in peripartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality associated with infections in pregnancy are increasing even in developed countries. Recently published data from the Center for Disease Control's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System indicates that although maternal mortality from hemorrhage, embolism, and anesthesia has declined in the United States, the proportion of maternal deaths due to infections has increased. During 1991–7 infection accounted for 13.2% of pregnancy-related deaths overall and 36.3% of abortion-related deaths. The greatest infection risk is found in blacks, older women, women without prenatal care, and women with multiple pregnancy. In the United States pregnancy rates are stable or increasing in these groups. Infection is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the fetus and newborn. Many perinatal infections are associated with intra-uterine growth retardation and low birthweight, or cause fetal and neonatal brain injury. Infections, particularly bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, can result in preterm delivery of live-born infants (delivery before 37 weeks gestation), or stillbirth. A multitude of immunologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, physiologic, and anatomic changes influence the likelihood and course of many infections during pregnancy. Some of these changes are intrinsic, and occur in all normal pregnancies, while others occur to varying degrees in normal and abnormal pregnancies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a pleiotropic signaling mediator of many cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10. STAT3 is known to play critical roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, immunity and inflammatory responses. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection on the STAT3 signaling since PRRSV induces a weak protective immune response in host animals. We report here that PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells and primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages led to significant reduction of STAT3 protein level. Several strains of both PRRSV type 1 and type 2 led to a similar reduction of STAT3 protein level but had a minimal effect on its transcripts. The PRRSV-mediated STAT3 reduction was in a dose-dependent manner as the STAT3 level decreased, along with incremental amounts of PRRSV inocula. Further study showed that nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) of PRRSV induced the STAT3 degradation by increasing its polyubiquitination level and shortening its half-life from 24 h to ∼3.5 h. The C-terminal domain of nsp5 was shown to be required for the STAT3 degradation. Moreover, the STAT3 signaling in the cells transfected with nsp5 plasmid was significantly inhibited. These results indicate that PRRSV antagonizes the STAT3 signaling by accelerating STAT3 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. This study provides insight into the PRRSV interference with the JAK/STAT3 signaling, leading to perturbation of the host innate and adaptive immune responses. IMPORTANCE The typical features of immune responses in PRRSV-infected pigs are delayed onset and low levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, as well as weak cell-mediated immunity. Lymphocyte development and differentiation rely on cytokines, many of which signal through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway to exert their biological effects. Here, we discovered that PRRSV antagonizes the JAK/STAT3 signaling by inducing degradation of STAT3, a master transcription activator involved in multiple cellular processes and the host immune responses. The nsp5 protein of PRRSV is responsible for the accelerated STAT3 degradation. The PRRSV-mediated antagonizing STAT3 could lead to suppression of a broad spectrum of cytokines and growth factors to allow virus replication and spread in host animals. This may be one of the reasons for the PRRSV interference with the innate immunity and its poor elicitation of protective immunity. This finding provides insight into PRRSV pathogenesis and its interference with the host immune responses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The post-translational attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers (ULMs) to proteins regulates many cellular processes including the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens. Vice versa, pathogens counteract immune defense by inhibiting or redirecting the ubiquitination machinery of the host. A common immune evasion strategy is for viruses to target host immunoproteins for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation by employing viral or host ubiquitin ligases. By degrading key host adaptor and signaling molecules, viruses thus disable multiple immune response pathways including the production of and response to interferons as well as other innate host defense mechanisms. Recent work further revealed that viruses inhibit the ligation of ubiquitin or ULMs or remove ubiquitin from host cell proteins.

      "Error parsing: Overuse of emergency rooms (ER) is a public health problem. To investigate this issue, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at the ERs of King Abdul-Aziz Hospital, King Fahd Hospital, and Al-Thaghor Hospital in November 2013 with the aims of estimating emergency service utilization for non-urgent cases, identifying the predictors of ER utilization for non-urgent cases, and measuring patients’ knowledge of primary healthcare centers (PHCCs). Patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. We recruited 300 patients; males comprised 50.7% of the sample. A higher proportion of patients with non-urgent cases visited the ER three to four times a year (P=0.001). A higher proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to visit an outpatient clinic before the ER (P=0.003). Most patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult in case of illness. Most patients who visited the ER were single, < 15 years, and had lower incomes. Patients requested ER services for primary care-treatable conditions because of limited services and resources as well as limited working hours at PHCCs. Most patients (90.0%) were knowledgeable about PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable. Patients reported long ER waiting times (≥ 3 hours), no organization (85.9%), and lack of medical staff. Overall, overuse of ER services is high at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah. The risk factors for ER overuse are age < 15 years, singlehood, and low incomes. Policy makers and health providers have a challenging task to control ER overuse. We recommend developing strategies to implement policies aimed at reducing non-urgent ER use as well as making healthcare services more available to the population.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: The white backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), causes great damage to many crops by direct feeding or transmitting plant viruses. Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by WBPH, has become a great threat to rice production in East Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By de novo transcriptome assembling and massive parallel pyrosequencing, we constructed two transcriptomes of WBPH and profiled the alternation of gene expression in response to SRBSDV infection in transcriptional level. Over 25 million reads of high-quality DNA sequences and 81388 different unigenes were generated using Illumina technology from both viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH. WBPH has a very similar gene ontological distribution to other two closely related rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus. 7291 microsatellite loci were also predicted which could be useful for further evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated from viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH provided a list of candidate transcripts that potentially were elicited as a response to viral infection. Pathway analyses of a subset of these transcripts indicated that SRBSDV infection may perturb primary metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. In addition, 5.5% (181 out of 3315) of the genes in cell cytoskeleton organization pathway showed obvious changes. Our data also demonstrated that SRBSDV infection activated the immunity regulatory systems of WBPH, such as RNA interference, autophagy and antimicrobial peptide production. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We employed massively parallel pyrosequencing to collect ESTs from viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples of WBPH. 81388 different unigenes have been obtained. We for the first time described the direct effects of a Reoviridae family plant virus on global gene expression profiles of its insect vector using high-throughput sequencing. Our study will provide a road map for future investigations of the fascinating interactions between Reoviridae viruses and their insect vectors, and provide new strategies for crop protection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Antigen-specific immunotherapy and the employment of proteasome inhibitors have emerged as two potentially plausible approaches for the control of cancer. In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the proteasome inhibitor; bortezomib for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We found that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and better therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor bearing mice compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, we found that treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells and could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CTLs.

      "Error parsing: INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial infections in patients with systemic inflammation remains challenging both for clinician and laboratory. Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed – one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six – and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test. The AUC of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of the single markers. CONCLUSION: Combining information from several markers improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF had limited value as single markers, whereas PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics.

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic potential and clinical impact of an automated multiplex PCR platform (the FilmArray Respiratory Panel; FA‐RP), specially designed for pathogen detection in respiratory tract infections in adults with unexplained pneumonia (UP). METHODS: A total of 112 UP patients in Shanghai, China, were enrolled prospectively and assessed using the FA‐RP from October 2016 to March 2018. We examined the test results and their influence on clinical decisions. Furthermore, as a control group, we retrospectively obtained the clinical data of 70 UP patients between October 2014 and March 2016 (before the FA‐RP was available). The two patient groups were compared with respect to factors, including general antimicrobial use and defined daily dose (DDD) numbers. RESULTS: Between October 2016 and March 2018, the positive rate obtained using FA‐RP for UP was 76.8%. The primary pathogens in adults with UP were Influenza A/B (47.3%, 53/112). Compared with the patients before FA‐RP was available, patients who underwent FA‐RP testing had higher rates of antiviral drug use and antibiotic de‐escalation during clinical treatment. FA‐RP significantly decreased the total DDDs of antibiotic or antifungal drugs DDDs by 7 days after admission (10.6 ± 2.5 vs 14.1 ± 8.8, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The FA‐RP is a rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification test method for UP diagnosis in adults. The application of FA‐RP may lead to a more accurately targeted antimicrobial treatment and reduced use of antibiotic/antifungal drugs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract Although influenza A and B viruses are primarily known as respiratory viruses and mainly infected only the upper respiratory tract in humans, patients with influenza often develop signs and symptoms that are not due to the respiratory system. Frequently individuals with influenza develop headaches, meningismus, and even seizures in addition to their typical respiratory symptoms. In the past decades, influenza viruses have also been associated with serious non-respiratory signs. The famous 1918 strain of influenza was associated with von Economo's encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism. In the 1960s influenza virus infections in children were associated with Reye's syndrome characterized often by fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease and an encephalopathy with marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema. Intermittently children with influenza develop focal myalgia and myositis. Guillain–Barré syndrome was epidemiologically associated with the 1978 killed influenza vaccine but not subsequent vaccines. Although occasional children with influenza have developed encephalopathy, from 2000 through 2004 there was an increase in the number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy accompanying infection with the influenza A 2009 strain. The current H5N1 strain of bird influenza occasionally infects humans with a high mortality rate and some appear to have central nervous signs. This chapter explores what is known about these influenza neurologic associations.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background Intravascular-thrombosis and extravascular-lipid-deposition are the two key pathogenic events considered to interrupt intraosseous blood supply during steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) development. However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors' published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids. Objective The present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model. Methods After receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON, eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n =28; 5 mg·kg−1·day−1), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n =28; 10 mg·kg−1·day−1), and control vehicle group (CON; n =28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression. Results The ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p <0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p <0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group. Conclusion Icaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dose-dependent effect on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition. Suppression of the up-regulated PPARgamma expression for extravascular adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and protection from activated oxidative stress for intravascular endothelium injury were found to be involved in the underlying mechanisms.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Type III interferons (IFNs), also termed lambda IFNs (IFNλs) or interleukins-28/29, constitute a new addition to the IFN family. They are induced upon infection and are particularly abundant at barrier surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Although they signal through a unique heterodimeric receptor complex comprising IFNLR1 and IL10RB, they activate a downstream signaling pathway remarkably similar to that of type I IFNs and share many functions with them. Yet, they also have important differences which are only now starting to unfold. Here, we review the current literature implicating type III IFNs in the regulation of immunity and homeostasis in the respiratory tract. We survey the common and unique characteristics of type III IFNs in terms of expression patterns, cellular targets, and biological activities and discuss their emerging role in first line defenses against respiratory viral infections. We further explore their immune modulatory functions and their involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses during chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Type III IFNs are, therefore, arising as front-line guardians of immune defenses in the respiratory tract, fine tuning inflammation, and as potential novel therapeutics for the treatment of diverse respiratory diseases, including influenza virus infection and asthma.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The four mammalian phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases modulate inter-organelle lipid trafficking, phosphoinositide signalling and intracellular vesicle trafficking. In addition to catalytic domains required for the synthesis of PI4P, the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases also contain isoform-specific structural motifs that mediate interactions with proteins such as AP-3 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, and such structural differences determine isoform-specific roles in membrane trafficking. Moreover, different permutations of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase isozymes may be required for a single cellular function such as occurs during distinct stages of GPCR signalling and in Golgi to lysosome trafficking. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases have recently been implicated in human disease. Emerging paradigms include increased phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase expression in some cancers, impaired functioning associated with neurological pathologies, the subversion of PI4P trafficking functions in bacterial infection and the activation of lipid kinase activity in viral disease. We discuss how the diverse and sometimes overlapping functions of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases present challenges for the design of isoform-specific inhibitors in a therapeutic context.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract The spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is responsible for host cell attachment and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Within S the receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV host cell receptor. Both S and the RBD are highly immunogenic and both have been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Reported here is the X-ray crystal structure of the RBD in complex with the Fab of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody, F26G19, elicited by immunization with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV. The RBD–F26G19 Fab complex represents the first example of the structural characterization of an antibody elicited by an immune response to SARS-CoV or any fragment of it. The structure reveals that the RBD surface recognized by F26G19 overlaps significantly with the surface recognized by ACE2 and, as such, suggests that F26G19 likely neutralizes SARS-CoV by blocking the virus–host cell interaction.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Methods A cross-sectional survey approach was used to explore HCWs perceptions in 2 emergency departments of the current algorithms for management of potentially infectious respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. Results Surveys from 96 HCWs revealed that algorithms were perceived as invaluable in protecting staff, patients, and colleagues. Differences in self-reported compliance, clarity, and ease of implementation of the respiratory algorithm were noted between facilities, likely reflecting variation in the physical plant.

      "Error parsing: Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential component of a number of metabolic pathways and thiamine deficiency results in a progressive encephalopathy in both humans and animals. Confirming thiamine deficiency is problematic and relies on demonstrating reduced red blood cells transketolase activity, or indirect methods including urinary organic acid analysis and dietary analysis. The characteristic and selective vulnerability of different brain regions in carnivores has been demonstrated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the dog and cat as an aid to diagnosis. A 2-year-old, female, domestic shorthair cat was presented with an acute onset of seizures and ataxia. MR imaging was consistent with thiamine deficiency and supplementation resulted in a progressive clinical improvement. Repeated MR imaging 4 days after starting thiamine supplementation revealed near complete resolution of the MR abnormalities. Repeated MR imaging following appropriate therapy may be useful to further confirm thiamine deficiency.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Certain disulfide bonds present in leucocyte membrane proteins are labile and can be reduced in inflammation. This can cause structural changes that result in downstream functional effects, for example, in integrin activation. Recent studies have shown that a wide range of membrane proteins have labile disulfide bonds including CD132, the common gamma chain of the receptors for several cytokines including interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 (IL-2 and IL-4). The Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond in mouse CD132 is susceptible to reduction by enzymes such as thioredoxin (TRX), gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase and protein disulfide isomerase, which are commonly secreted during immune activation. The Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond is also reduced in an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute model of inflammation. Conditions that lead to the reduction of the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond in CD132 inhibit proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell clone and concomitant inhibition of the STAT-5 signalling pathway. The same reducing conditions had no effect on the proliferation of an IL-2-independent T cell clone, nor did they reduce disulfide bonds in IL-2 itself. We postulate that reduction of the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide in CD132 inhibits IL-2 binding to the receptor complex. Published data show that the Cys(183)–Cys(232) disulfide bond is exposed at the surface of CD132 and in close contact with IL-2 and IL-4 in their respective receptor complexes. In addition, mutants in these Cys residues in human CD132 lead to immunodeficiency and loss of IL-2 binding. These results have wider implications for the regulation of cytokine receptors in general, as their activity can be modulated by a ‘redox regulator’ mechanism caused by the changes in the redox environment that occur during inflammation and activation of the immune system.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: The mental health impact of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic has been described among survivors, family members and healthcare workers, but little is known about its impact on the general population of affected countries. We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population in Sierra Leone after over a year of outbreak response. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey in July 2015 to a national sample of 3564 consenting participants selected through multistaged cluster sampling. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised. Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%). In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis. Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat. Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms. Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences. Preventing, detecting, and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Firstly, Nepal is an emerging tourist destination and 2020 has been declared “Visit Nepal” year with an expected 500,000 tourists. Among the total number of tourists in 2018, 153633, the second-highest number, were Chinese tourists, with the highest influx during February and December.6 COVID-19 outbreak coincides (similar to SARS) with Chinese new year during which the Chinese travel extensively, increasing chances for transmission.7 Study into coronavirus infections in Nepal, has shown the incidence to be higher in winter (DecemberFebruary).8 Furthermore, Nepal shares northern border with China with several border crossing points. Several Nepalese students study in China and in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Thus, the potential for the spread of COVID-19 through travel and the overlap between the months of peak tourist season in Nepal and the months of the emergence of the epidemic could pose a risk to Nepal. One confirmed case in Nepal was a Nepalese student, studying in Wuhan, with symptom-onset on January 3. The infected 32-year-old male had returned on January 9 to spend winter holidays in Nepal. He had prior knowledge about the outbreak in China and visited the Sukraraj Tropical (truncated): Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Human herpesvirus type 6B (HHV-6B) is a strong inducer of IFN-alpha and has the capacity to promote Th1 responses and block Th2 responses in vitro. In this study we addressed whether inactivated HHV-6B can also induce IFN lambda responses and to what extent interferons alpha and lambda affect Th1/Th2 polarization. We show that inactivated HHV-6B induced IFN-lambda1 (IL-29) but not IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A) responses in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction was mediated through TLR9. We have previously shown that HHV-6B promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 responses in both humans and mice. We now show that neutralization of IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 blocked the HHV-6B-induced enhancement of Th1 responses in MLR, but did not affect the HHV-6-induced dampening of Th2 responses. Similarly, blockage of TLR9 counteracted HHV-6Bs effects on the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 promoted IFN-gamma production and blocked IL-5 and IL-13 production in purified CD4+ T-cells. The lack of effect of IFN-lambda1 correlated with the absence of the IFN-lambda receptor IL-28Ralfa chain on the cell surface of both resting and activated CD4+ T-cells. We conclude that inactivated HHV-6B is a strong inducer of IFN-lambda1 in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction is TLR9-dependent. However, human CD4+ T-cells do not express the IFN-lambda receptor and are refractory to IFN-lambda1 treatment. The HHV-6B-induced alterations in the Th1/Th2 balance are instead mediated mainly through TLR9 and IFN-alpha.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Human infectious disease is classified into five etiologies: bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, and prion. Viral infections are unique in that they recruit human cellular machinery to replicate themselves and spread infection. The number of viruses causing human disease is vast, and viruses can be broadly categorized by their structures. Many viruses, such as influenza, appear to be amorphous particles, whereas others, such as herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, dengue virus, and adenovirus, have roughly symmetric structural components. Icosahedral viruses have been a target of electron microscopists for years, and they were some of the first objects to be reconstructed three-dimensionally from electron micrographs. The ease with which highly purified and conformationally uniform virus samples can be produced makes them an ideal target structural studies. Apart from their biological significance, these virus samples have played a pivotal role in the development of new methodologies in the field of molecular biology as well as in cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The propagations of diseases, behaviors and information in real systems are rarely independent of each other, but they are coevolving with strong interactions. To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, the evolving spatiotemporal patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading are extremely important, which provide theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attention in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progress in the study of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspectives of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms, and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, epidemic–awareness, and epidemic–resources, are presented in detail, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary This chapter describes the RNA structural characteristics that have emerged so far. Folded RNA molecules are stabilized by a variety of interactions, the most prevalent of which are stacking and hydrogen bonding between bases. Many interactions among backbone atoms also occur in the structure of tRNA, although they are often ignored when considering RNA structure because they are not as well-characterized as interactions among bases. Backbone interactions include hydrogen bonding and the stacking of sugar or phosphate groups with bases or with other sugar and phosphate groups. The interactions found in a three-dimensional RNA structure can be divided into two categories: secondary interactions and tertiary interactions. This division is useful for several reasons. Secondary structures are routinely determined by a combination of techniques discussed in chapter, whereas tertiary interactions are more difficult to determine. Computer algorithms that generate RNA structures can search completely through possible secondary structures, but the inclusion of tertiary interactions makes a complete search of possible structures impractical for RNA molecules even as small as tRNA. The division of RNA structure into building blocks consisting of secondary or tertiary interactions makes it easier to describe RNA structures. In those cases in which RNA studies are incomplete, the studies of DNA are described with the rationalization that RNA structures may be analogous to DNA structures, or that the techniques used to study DNA could be applied to the analogous RNA structures. The chapter focuses on the aspects of RNA structure that affect the three-dimensional shape of RNA and that affect its ability to interact with other molecules.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Iridoviruses are nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses which cause great economic losses in the aquaculture industry but also show significant threat to global biodiversity. However, a lack of host cells has resulted in poor progress in clarifying iridovirus behavior. We investigated the crucial events during virus entry using a combination of single-virus tracking and biochemical assays, based on the established virus-cell infection model for Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV). SGIV infection in host cells was strongly inhibited when cells were pretreated with drugs blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including sucrose and chlorpromazine. Inhibition of key regulators of macropinocytosis, including Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, Rac1 GTPase, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), protein kinase C (PKC), and myosin II, significantly reduced SGIV uptake. Cy5-labeled SGIV particles were observed to colocalize with clathrin and macropinosomes. In contrast, disruption of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin had no effect on virus infection, suggesting that SGIV entered grouper cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and macropinocytosis but not via caveola-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, inhibitors of endosome acidification such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 blocked virus infection, indicating that SGIV entered cells in a pH-dependent manner. In addition, SGIV particles were observed to be transported along both microtubules and actin filaments, and intracellular SGIV motility was remarkably impaired by depolymerization of microtubules or actin filaments. The results of this study for the first time demonstrate that not only the clathrin-dependent pathway but also macropinocytosis are involved in fish DNA enveloped virus entry, thus providing a convenient tactic for exploring the life cycle of DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Virus entry into host cells is critically important for initiating infections and is usually recognized as an ideal target for the design of antiviral strategies. Iridoviruses are large DNA viruses which cause serious threats to ecological diversity and the aquaculture industry worldwide. However, the current understanding of iridovirus entry is limited and controversial. Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is a novel marine fish DNA virus which belongs to genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae. Here, using single-virus tracking technology in combination with biochemical assays, we investigated the crucial events during SGIV entry and demonstrated that SGIV entered grouper cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway in a pH-dependent manner but not via caveola-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we propose for the first time that macropinocytosis is involved in iridovirus entry. Together, this work not only contributes greatly to understating iridovirus pathogenesis but also provides an ideal model for exploring the behavior of DNA viruses in living cells.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Intradermal administration of DNA vaccines via a gene gun represents a feasible strategy to deliver DNA directly into the professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin. This helps to facilitate the enhancement of DNA vaccine potency via strategies that modify the properties of APCs. We have previously demonstrated that DNA vaccines encoding human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen linked to calreticulin (CRT) are capable of enhancing the E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses and antitumor effects against E7-expressing tumors. It has also been shown that cluster (short-interval) DNA vaccination regimen generates potent immune responses in a minimal timeframe. Thus, in the current study we hypothesize that the cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination will generate significant antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell infiltrates in E7-expressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice, leading to an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death. We found that cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination is capable of rapidly generating a significant number of E7-specific CD8(+) T cells, resulting in significant therapeutic antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We also observed that cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination in the presence of tumor generates significantly higher E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses in the systemic circulation as well as in the tumors. In addition, this vaccination regimen also led to significantly lower levels of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells and myeloid suppressor cells compared to vaccination with CRT DNA in peripheral blood and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death. Thus, our study has significant potential for future clinical translation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Taiwan experienced a large number of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral infections between March and July 2003; by September of that year, 346 SARS cases were confirmed by RT-PCR or serological tests. In order to better understand evolutionary relationships among SARS coronaviruses (SCoVs) from different international regions, we performed phylogenetic comparisons of full-length genomic and protein sequences from 45 human SCoVs (including 12 from Taiwan) and two civet SCoVs. All the Taiwanese SARS-CoV strains which associated with nosocomial infection formed a monophyletic clade within the late phase of the SARS epidemic. This Taiwanese clade could be further divided into two epidemic waves. Taiwan SCoVs in the first wave clustered with three isolates from the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong indicating their possible origin. Of the 45 human SCoVs, one isolate from Guangdong province, China, exhibited an extra 29-nucleotide fragment between Orf 10 and Orf 11—similar to the civet SCoV genome. Nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons suggested that all SCoVs of late epidemic came from human-to-human transmission, while certain SCoVs of early epidemic might have originated in animals.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are recently emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses exclusively grouped within a new genus, Henipavirus. These viruses cause fatal disease in a wide range of species, including humans. Both NiV and HeV have continued to re-emerge sporadically in Bangladesh and Australia, respectively. There are currently no therapeutics or vaccines available to treat Henipavirus infection and both are classified as BSL4 pathogens. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in animal and plant cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNAi by inhibiting gene expression of homologous mRNA and our preliminary studies suggest RNAi may be a useful approach to developing novel therapies for these highly lethal pathogens. Eight NiV siRNA molecules (four L and four N gene specific), two HeV N gene specific, and two non-specific control siRNA molecules were designed and tested for their ability to inhibit a henipavirus minigenome replication system (which does not require the use of live virus) in addition to live virus infections in vitro. In the minigenome assay three out of the four siRNAs that targeted the L gene of NiV effectively inhibited replication. In contrast, only NiV N gene siRNAs were effective in reducing live NiV replication, suggesting inhibition of early, abundantly expressed gene transcripts may be more effective than later, less abundant transcripts. Additionally, some of the siRNAs effective against NiV infection were only partially effective inhibitors of HeV infection. An inverse correlation between the number of nucleotide mismatches and the efficacy of siRNA inhibition was observed. The demonstration that RNAi effectively inhibits henipavirus replication in vitro, is a novel approach and may provide an effective therapy for these highly lethal, zoonotic pathogens.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Results show that both CD4+ and CD8+ T clones can process and present HBenvAg to class II-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and that the CD71 transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in efficient HBenvAg uptake by T cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the HBenvAg sequence interacting with the T cell surface is contained within the pre-S2 region. Since TfR is also expressed on hepatocytes, it might represent a portal of cellular entry for HBV infection.

Late clinical presentation has meant that human CMV (HCMV) dissemination is not well understood. Murine CMV (MCMV) provides a tractable model. Whole mouse imaging of virus-expressed luciferase has proved a useful way to track systemic infections. MCMV, in which the abundant lytic gene M78 was luciferase-tagged via a self-cleaving peptide (M78-LUC), allowed serial, unbiased imaging of systemic and peripheral infection without significant virus attenuation. Ex vivo luciferase imaging showed greater sensitivity than plaque assay, and revealed both well-known infection sites (the lungs, lymph nodes, salivary glands, liver, spleen and pancreas) and less explored sites (the bone marrow and upper respiratory tract). We applied luciferase imaging to tracking MCMV lacking M33, a chemokine receptor conserved in HCMV and a proposed anti-viral drug target. M33-deficient M78-LUC colonized normally in peripheral sites and local draining lymph nodes but spread poorly to the salivary gland, suggesting a defect in vascular transport consistent with properties of a chemokine receptor.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract There is little information on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in innate immunity to respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections. We examined NO levels by Greiss assay in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of pigs infected with either porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of Nidovirales, like CoV. The antiviral effects of NO on these two viruses were tested in an in vitro system using a NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). We detected a large increase in NO levels in BAL fluids of PRCV-infected pigs, but not in PRRSV-infected pigs. Pulmonary epithelial cell necrosis induced by PRCV coincided with increased NO. Moreover, NO levels in cell culture medium of PRRSV-infected alveolar macrophages (AMs) did not differ from that of mock-infected AMs. Antiviral assays showed that NO significantly inhibited PRCV replication in swine testicular (ST) cells, whereas PRRSV was not susceptible to NO based on the conditions tested. Our study suggests that unlike PRRSV which induces apoptosis in AMs, respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells and cause cytolysis, induce NO production in the respiratory tract. Thus, NO may play a role in innate immunity to respiratory CoV infections by inhibiting viral replication.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Search of cost-effective strategies that can enhance the accumulation of phytochemicals of pharmaceutical interest in plant in vitro cultures is an essential task. For the first time, Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet-A, ultraviolet-B, and ultraviolet-C) in an attempt to promote the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 ± 198.19 μg/g DW) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared with that in control (439.68 ± 8.27 μg/g DW). Additionally, antioxidant activity enhancement and cell wall reinforcement were found in the treated I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, indicating the positive-feedback responses to oxidative stress mediated by ultraviolet-B radiation. Moreover, the expression of chalcone synthase gene was tremendously up-regulated (up to 405.84-fold) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures following ultraviolet-B radiation, which suggested chalcone synthase gene might play a crucial role in flavonoid augmentation. Overall, the present work provides a feasible approach for the enhanced production of biologically active flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures via the simple supplementation of ultraviolet-B radiation, which is useful for the biotechnological production of these high-added value compounds to fulfil the ever-increasing demand in pharmaceutical fields.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) will be key players in any response to pandemic influenza, and will be in the front line of exposure to infection. Responding effectively to a pandemic relies on the majority of medical, nursing, laboratory and hotel services staff continuing to work normally. Planning assumes that during a pandemic normal healthcare service levels will be provided, although it anticipates that as caseloads increase only essential care will be provided. The ability of the NHS to provide expected service levels is entirely dependent upon HCWs continuing to work as normal. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as a two-phase multi-method study, incorporating focus groups and a questionnaire survey. In phase one, qualitative methods will be used to collect the views of a purposive sample of HCWs, to determine the range of factors associated with their responses to the prospect of working through pandemic influenza. In phase two, the findings from the focus groups, combined with the available literature, will be used to inform the design of a survey to determine the generalisability of these factors, enabling the estimation of the likely proportion of HCWs affected by each factor, and how likely it is that they would be willing and/or able to continue to work during an influenza pandemic. DISCUSSION: There are potentially greater than normal health risks for some healthcare workers working during a pandemic, and these workers may be concerned about infecting family members/friends. HCWs will be as liable as other workers to care for sick family members and friends. It is vital to have information about how motivated HCWs will be to continue to work during such a crisis, and what factors might influence their decision to work/not to work. Through the identification and subsequent management of these factors it may be possible to implement strategies that will alleviate the concerns and fears of HCWs and remove potential barriers to working.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Autophagy is an essential process in eukaryotic cells in which autophagosomes form to deliver cellular organelles and long-lived proteins to lysosomes for degradation. Many studies have recently identified the regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction between viral infection and autophagy. METHODS: LC3 turnover and the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway were investigated using western blot analysis. The formation and degradation of autophagosomes were detected using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Autophagy was activated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9, which are two transmembrane proteins and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The formation of autophagosomes was induced by NSP3 and NSP5 and developed from the ER; the fusion of these autophagosomes with lysosomes was limited. Although NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, these proteins did not activate the ER stress signaling pathways. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of NSP3 plays a pivotal role in activating autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this study reveal an important relationship between PRRSV NSPs and autophagy and provide new insights that improve our understanding of the involvement of PRRSV NSPs in the autophagy process.

      "Error parsing: We report an association between thymic epithelial defects and predisposition to autoimmunity. Diabetes-prone (DP) BB rats develop spontaneous hyperglycemia and are deficient in T cell subsets expressing the RT6 alloantigen. Diabetes resistant (DR) BB rats become diabetic if depleted of RT6+ T cells. The inciting immune system defects are unknown. We made the following observations: 1) Regions of thymic cortex and medulla devoid of thymic epithelium exist in DP-BB, DR-BB, and Lewis rats, all of which are susceptible to autoimmune disorders. Such defects were absent in eight normal rat strains. 2) Thymic epithelial defects are absent at birth, but present in BB rats at 4 weeks of age. 3) The genetic predisposition to thymic epithelial defects is an autosomal dominant trait. 4) The observation of thymic defects in (DP x WF)F1 rats led to the prediction that such animals, which never develop spontaneous autoimmunity, might be susceptible to its induction. Following depletion of RT6+ T cells we observed diabetes in 91%, and thyroiditis in 43%, of treated F1 animals (n = 23). Pancreatic insulitis was uniformly present. Because thymic epithelium participates in the positive and negative selection of developing thymocytes, we propose that thymic epithelial defects may play an important role in the predisposition of BB rats to autoimmunity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract RNA granules are structures within cells that impart key regulatory measures on gene expression. Two general types of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain many translation initiation factors, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched for proteins involved in RNA turnover. Because of the inverse relationship between appearance of RNA granules and persistence of translation, many viruses must subvert RNA granule function for replicative purposes. Here we discuss the viruses and mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Several themes have emerged for manipulation of RNA granules by viruses: (1) disruption of RNA granules at the mid-phase of infection, (2) prevention of RNA granule assembly throughout infection and (3) co-opting of RNA granule proteins for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction. Viruses must employ one or multiple of these routes for a robust and productive infection to occur. The possible role for RNA granules in promoting innate immune responses poses an additional reason why viruses must counteract the effects of RNA granules for efficient replication.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The term ‘domain swapping,’ originally coined by D. Eisenberg, describes a scenario in which two or more polypeptide chains exchange identical units for oligomerization. This type of assembly could play a role in disease-related aggregation and amyloid formation or as a specific mechanism for regulating function. This chapter introduces terms and features concerning domain swapping, summarizes ideas about its putative mechanisms, reports on domain-swapped structures collected from the literature, and describes a few notable examples in detail.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: DExD/H-box helicase 36 (DHX36) is known to be an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that unwinds the guanine-quadruplexes DNA or RNA, but emerging data suggest that it also functions as pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide. Interstitial pneumonia is considered to be one of the most obvious clinical signs of PRRSV infection, suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis. However, whether DHX36 is involved in PRRSV-induced inflammatory cytokine expression remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection increased the expression of DHX36. Knockdown of DHX36 and its adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) by small-interfering RNA in MARC-145 cells significantly reduced NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after PRRSV infection. Further investigation revealed that PRRSV nucleocapsid protein interacted with the N-terminal quadruplex binding domain of DHX36, which in turn augmented nucleocapsid protein-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results suggest that DHX36–MyD88 has a relevant role in the recognition of PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and in the subsequent activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Every channel consists of one manufacturer and many (a sufficiently large number of) retailers that sell products in different markets by adopting two pure marketing strategies: profit maximization and revenue maximization. We find that revenue maximization strategy may prevail and profit maximization strategy may become extinct. Two strategies may coexist, i.e., all retailers in one channel will choose profit maximization strategy and all retailers in the other will choose revenue maximization strategy. The ESS of retailers depends on the relative size of the market scale and unit cost. The supply chain disruptions affect the ESS of retailers. We also introduce a recovery model of the supply chain under disruptions and illustrate the effect of disruptions on the ESS and on the average profits of channels in a market using a numerical simulation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Exosomes have been shown to function in antigen presentation and tumor metastasis, and in transmitting infectious agents. However, little is known about the biogenesis and function of exosomes in polarized cells.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the predominant cause of severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea in swine. The lack of effective therapeutical treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals. In this study, we identified Q7R, which actively inhibited PEDV replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.014μg/mL. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of Q7R was over 100μg/mL and the derived therapeutic index was 7142. Several structural analogues of Q7R, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and catechin, also showed moderate anti-PEDV activity. Antiviral drugs and natural compounds revealed ribavirin, interferon-α, coumarin and tannic acid have relative weaker efficacy compared to Q7R. Q7R did not directly interact with or inactivate PEDV particles and affect the initial stage of PEDV infection by interfering of PEDV replication. Also, the effectiveness of Q7R against the other two viruses (TGEV, PRCV) was lower compared to PEDV. Q7R could be considered as a lead compound for development of anti-PEDV drugs to may be used to during the early stage of PEDV replication and the structure-activity data of Q7R may usefully guideline to design other related antiviral agents.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Ecohealth is a comprehensive approach to understanding health at its human, animal and environmental interface in a socio-ecological systems context. This approach was introduced widely in Southeast Asia (SEA) by the Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in the late 2000s. Aimed at addressing the problem of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), numerous such projects and activities have been generated throughout the region. Ecohealth is increasingly converging with the One Health approach, as both movements emphasise a holistic understanding to health. We conducted a scoping review by considering all of the Ecohealth programmes, initiatives and projects that have been implemented in SEA since the introduction of the approach, and also gathered information from peer-reviewed literature. The objective of this paper is to review Ecohealth activities within SEA over the last 10 years to address the lessons learned, challenges faced and the way forward for Ecohealth in the region. Activities range from those focusing purely on capacity, projects focusing on research and projects covering both. Achievements to date include, for example, research contributing to the field of infectious diseases in relation to social ecological factors and associated urbanisation and agricultural intensification. Challenges remain at the project design and implementation level, in the available capacity and coordination to develop Ecohealth research teams in the countries, gauging teams’ assimilation of Ecohealth’s underlying tenets and their translation into sustainable disease prevention and control, as well as in the ability to scale up Ecohealth projects. We suggest that the way forward for Ecohealth should be from a regional perspective in terms of research, training and policy translation using Ecohealth in combination with the One Health approach.

      "Error parsing: Abstract The contribution of oligosaccharides to the structural and functional make-up of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus G and F proteins was investigated by observing the effects of various oligosaccharide-specific enzymes on their molecular size as well as on virus infectivity. The N-linked oligosaccharides of the F protein were completely removed by endoglycosidase F and N-glycanase. Addition of oligosaccharides to F protein during synthesis was completely partially resistant to TM resulting in an 80-kDa form designated GTM. The G protein was estimated to contain approximately 3% N-linked and 55% O-linked carbohydrates, based on migration of G and GTM in polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, treatment of detergent-extracted G protein with endoglycosidase F and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, enzymes that specifically cleave N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, generated a variety of partially unglycosylated species, ranging in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 40 kDa. Virus infectivity was sensitive to limited removal of N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidases under conditions which did not greatly alter the molecular weight of the G protein. Thus, G and F protein oligosaccharides readily accessible to enzymatic removal are presumed to play an important role in the infectious process.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Acute renal impairment in coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome. Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Results Among these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5–48 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation. The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure. Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died. The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs. 8.8%) (P < 0.0001). Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of acute renal impairment in SARS. Conclusion Acute renal impairment is uncommon in SARS but carries a high mortality. The acute renal impairment is likely to be related to multi-organ failure rather than the kidney tropism of the virus. The development of acute renal impairment is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with SARS.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Owing to their high versatility, a nanomechanical sensor is one of the most promising sensors which can be adapted to various monitoring systems. In this study, we present an optimization strategy to efficiently detect small particles with nanomechanical sensors. Adsorption of particles on the receptor layer of nanomechanical sensors and the resultant signal are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA). We investigate the effect of structural parameters (e.g., adsorption position and embedded depth of a particle and thickness of the receptor layer) and elastic properties of the receptor layer (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) on the sensitivity. It is found that a membrane-type surface stress sensors (MSS) has the potential for robust detection of small particles.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The nsp1 protein of the highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus suppresses host protein synthesis, including genes involved in the innate immune system. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that the nsp1 proteins of group I and SARS coronaviruses have similar structures. Nsp1 proteins of group I coronaviruses interacted with host ribosomal 40S subunit and did not inhibit IRF-3 activation. However, synthesis of host immune and non-immune proteins was inhibited by nsp1 proteins at both transcriptional and translational levels, similar to SARS coronavirus nsp1. These results indicate that different coronaviruses might employ the same nsp1 mechanism to antagonize host innate immunity and cell proliferation. However, nsp1 may not be the key determinant of viral pathogenicity, or the factor used by the SARS coronavirus to evade host innate immunity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Vaccinia virus, the prototype of the Poxviridae, is a large DNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The assembly pathway of vaccinia virus displays several unique features, such as the production of two structurally distinct, infectious forms. One of these, termed intracellular naked virus (INV), remains cells associated while the other, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), is released from the cell. In addition, it has long been believed that INVs acquire their lipid envelopes by a unique example of de novo membrane biogenesis. To examine the structure and assembly of vaccinia virus we have used immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to proteins of different subcellular compartments as well as a phospholipid analysis of purified INV and EEV. Our data are not consistent with the de novo model of viral membrane synthesis but rather argue that the vaccinia virus DNA becomes enwrapped by a membrane cisterna derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step. Phospholipid analysis of purified INV supports its derivation from an early biosynthetic compartment. This unique assembly process is repeated once more when the INV becomes enwrapped by an additional membrane cisterna, in agreement with earlier reports. The available data suggest that after fusion between the outer envelope and the plasma membrane, mature EEV is released from the cell.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Recent researches revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on. RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In a population-based prospective multicenter study (the PRI.DE study, conducted in Germany over 2 years), we tested 3,369 nasopharyngeal secretions from children younger than 3 years of age with LRTIs for RSV A and B, influenza viruses (IVs) A and B, and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1 to 3. Of the children requiring intensive care (n = 85), 18% had hMPV infections, and 60% of these children were infected with hMPV in combination with RSV. We did not detect hMPV in a randomly selected subset of RSV-positive nasopharyngeal secretions (n = 120) from children not requiring intensive care support. hMPV was detected in <1% of virus-negative samples from patients without intensive care support (n = 620). Our data support the hypothesis that coinfections with RSV and hMPV are more severe than infections with either RSV or hMPV alone, at least in children younger than 3 years of age.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: During the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome, the viral DNA polymerase subunit UL44 plays a key role, as by binding both DNA and the polymerase catalytic subunit it confers processivity to the holoenzyme. However, several lines of evidence suggest that UL44 might have additional roles during virus life cycle. To shed light on this, we searched for cellular partners of UL44 by yeast two-hybrid screenings. Intriguingly, we discovered the interaction of UL44 with Ubc9, an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) to cellular and viral proteins. We found that UL44 can be extensively sumoylated not only in a cell-free system and in transfected cells, but also in HCMV-infected cells, in which about 50% of the protein resulted to be modified at late times post-infection, when viral genome replication is accomplished. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that UL44 possesses multiple SUMO target sites, located throughout the protein. Remarkably, we observed that binding of UL44 to DNA greatly stimulates its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that overexpression of SUMO alters the intranuclear distribution of UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, and enhances both virus production and DNA replication, arguing for an important role for sumoylation in HCMV life cycle and UL44 function(s). These data report for the first time the sumoylation of a viral processivity factor and show that there is a functional interplay between the HCMV UL44 protein and the cellular sumoylation system.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: To test the hypothesis that the 65-nucleotide (nt) leader on subgenomic mRNAs suffices as a 5'-terminal cis-acting signal for RNA replication, a corollary to the notion that coronavirus mRNAs behave as replicons, synthetic RNA transcripts of a cloned, reporter-containing N mRNA (mRNA 7) of the bovine coronavirus with a precise 5' terminus and a 3' poly(A) of 68 nt were tested for replication after being transfected into helper virus-infected cells. No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to reported natural mouse hepatitis coronavirus DI RNAs, the DI RNA of the bovine coronavirus does not require sequence elements originating from discontinuous downstream regions within the polymerase gene for replication or for packaging.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract In the present study, we fabricated a label-free avian influenza (AIV H5N1) detection biosensor composed of a multi-functional DNA 3 way-Junction (3 W J) on a hollow Au spike-like nanoparticle (hAuSN) using a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) method. To construct the multi-functional DNA (MF-DNA) as a bioprobe, the 3 W J was introduced. The proposed AIV detection bioprobe should contain three functionalities: target recognition, signal amplification, and connection to substrate. To achieve this goal, each piece of the DNA 3 W J was tailored to a hemagglutinin (HA) binding aptamer, FAM dye and thiol group, respectively. The assembly of each DNA 3 W J functional fragment was then confirmed by TBM-Native PAGE. Moreover, the hAuSN was immobilized on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate for LSPR measurement. The DNA 3 W J was immobilized onto the hAuSN electrode through the thiol-group of DNA 3 W J. The fabricated DNA 3 W J/hAuSN heterolayer on the ITO substrate was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). LSPR experiments were conducted to confirm HA protein binding to the DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN -modified electrode. The proposed biosensor can detected the HA protein in PBS buffer (LOD: 1 pM) as well as in the diluted chicken serum (LOD: 1 pM). The present study details a label-free, simple fabrication method consisted of DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN heterolayer that uses easy-to-tailor elements to detect not only AIV but also various viruses detection platform easily.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has infected more than 40 million people worldwide, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice. RESULTS: Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful, although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems; however, the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of p24 and p17/p24 yielded best, to more than 1 mg p24/kg fresh weight. Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC. CONCLUSION: Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested, and p24 and p17/p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag. Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. The p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC, showing that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The entry of avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) into host cells initially requires the fusion of viral and cell membranes, which is exclusively mediated by fusion (F) protein. Proteolysis of aMPV F protein by endogenous proteases of host cells allows F protein to induce membrane fusion; however, these proteases have not been identified. Here, we provide the first evidence that the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS12 facilitates the cleavage of subtype B aMPV (aMPV/B) F protein. We found that overexpression of TMPRSS12 enhanced aMPV/B F protein cleavage, F protein fusogenicity, and viral replication. Subsequently, knockdown of TMPRSS12 with specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reduced aMPV/B F protein cleavage, F protein fusogenicity, and viral replication. We also found a cleavage motif in the aMPV/B F protein (amino acids 100 and 101) that was recognized by TMPRSS12. The histidine, aspartic acid, and serine residue (HDS) triad of TMPRSS12 was shown to be essential for the proteolysis of aMPV/B F protein via mutation analysis. Notably, we observed TMPRSS12 mRNA expression in target organs of aMPV/B in chickens. Overall, our results indicate that TMPRSS12 is crucial for aMPV/B F protein proteolysis and aMPV/B infectivity and that TMPRSS12 may serve as a target for novel therapeutics and prophylactics for aMPV. IMPORTANCE Proteolysis of the aMPV F protein is a prerequisite for F protein-mediated membrane fusion of virus and cell and for aMPV infection; however, the proteases used in vitro and vivo are not clear. A combination of analyses, including overexpression, knockdown, and mutation methods, demonstrated that the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS12 facilitated cleavage of subtype B aMPV (aMPV/B) F protein. Importantly, we located the motif in the aMPV/B F protein recognized by TMPRSS12 and the catalytic triad in TMPRSS12 that facilitated proteolysis of the aMPV/B F protein. This is the first report on TMPRSS12 as a protease for proteolysis of viral envelope glycoproteins. Our study will shed light on the mechanism of proteolysis of aMPV F protein and pathogenesis of aMPV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth).: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: A novel eSensor respiratory viral panel (eSensor RVP) multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays for the detection of various respiratory viruses. A total of 250 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more viruses by real-time PCR were examined using the eSensor RVP. Overall agreement between the eSensor RVP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 99.2% (kappa = 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.94 to 0.98]). The combined positive percent agreement was 95.4% (95% CI, 92.5 to 97.3); the negative percent agreement was 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 39.73 (95% CI, 38.03 to 41.43). Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable between methods. Of note, the eSensor RVP rhinovirus assay was found to be more sensitive and specific than the corresponding rhinovirus real-time PCR. In contrast, the eSensor RVP adenovirus B, C, and E assays demonstrated some cross-reactivity when tested against known adenovirus serotypes representing groups A through F. The eSensor RVP is robust and relatively easy to perform, it involves a unique biosensor technology for target detection, and its multiplexed design allows for efficient and simultaneous interrogation of a single specimen for multiple viruses. Potential drawbacks include a slower turnaround time and the need to manipulate amplified product during the protocol, increasing the possibility of contamination.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses is a small polypeptide that contains at least one α-helical transmembrane domain. Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric α-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular α-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride. The channel structure presented herein provides a possible rationale for inhibition, and a platform for future structure-based drug design of this potential pharmacological target.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract Nutritional intervention in older dogs aims to increase lifespan and improve life quality as well as delay the development of diseases related to ageing. It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: West Nile virus (WNV) has been the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States since 1999. The endocytic processes involved in the internalization of infectious WNV by various cell types are not well characterized, and the involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, in the life cycle of WNV has not been investigated previously. In this study, we found that the depletion of cellular cholesterol levels by brief treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in a 100-fold reduction of the titers of infectious WNV released into the culture supernatant, as well as a reduction in the number of WNV genome copies in the cholesterol-depleted cells. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to cholesterol-depleted cells reversed this effect. Cholesterol depletion postinfection did not affect WNV growth, suggesting that the effect occurs at the level of WNV entry. We also showed that while WNV entry did not require αvβ3 integrin and focal adhesion kinase, WNV particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells. Finally, we showed the colocalization of the WNV envelope protein and cholera toxin B, which is internalized in a lipid raft-dependent pathway, in microdomain clusters at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that WNV utilizes lipid rafts during initial stages of internalization and that the lipid rafts may contain a factor(s) that may enhance WNV endocytosis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Many human viral infections have a zoonotic, i.e., wild or domestic animal, origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services. Methods It was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS. The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively. Results The overall response rate was 78.0%. Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%). The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.13, P=.008]. Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08–3.34, P=.026), younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.98, P=.021), increased self blame (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.22–2.28, P=.001), less substance use (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, P=.034) and posttraumatic morbidity was associated with increased use of denial (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04–1.67, P=.024), and planning (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16–1.95, P=.002) as coping measures. Conclusion These findings could potentially inform the development of practical community mental health programs for future infectious disease outbreaks.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &ldquo;coronavirus disease 2019&rdquo; (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. However recently, the need of agents effective against poxvirus infection has emerged again. In this paper, we report an original finding that two redox-modulating agents, the ethacrynic and α-lipoic acids (EA, LA), inhibit growth of vaccinia virus (VACV) in vitro. The effect of EA and LA was compared with those of β-mercaptoethanol, DTT and ascorbic acid, but these agents increased VACV growth in HeLa G cells. The inhibitory effects of EA and LA on the growth of VACV were further confirmed in several cell lines of different embryonic origin, in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and T-lymphocytes. Finally, we have analyzed the mechanism of action of the two agents. They both decreased expression of VACV late genes, as demonstrated by western blot analysis and activity of luciferase expressed under control of different VACV promoters. In contrast, they did not inhibit virus entry into the cell, expression of VACV early genes or VACV DNA synthesis. The results suggest new directions in development of drugs effective against poxvirus infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was shown to be associated with a novel coronavirus (CoV) now called SARS CoV. We report here the generation of SARS CoV S protein-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector particles. The wild-type S protein pseudotyped MLV vectors, although at a low efficiency. Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of S dramatically increased infectivity of pseudotypes, with titers only two- to threefold lower than those of pseudotypes generated in parallel with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. S-pseudotyped MLV particles were used to analyze viral tropism. MLV(SARS) pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV displayed similar cell types and tissue and host restrictions, indicating that the expression of a functional receptor is the major restraint in permissiveness to SARS CoV infection. Efficient gene transfer could be detected in Vero and CaCo2 cells, whereas the level of gene marking of 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells was only slightly above background levels. A cat cell line and a dog cell line were not susceptible. Interestingly, PK-15, a porcine kidney cell line, and primary porcine kidney cells were also highly permissive for SARS S pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV. This finding suggests that swine may be susceptible to SARS infection and may be a source for infection of humans. Taken together, these results indicate that MLV(SARS) pseudotypes are highly valuable for functional studies of viral tropism and entry and, in addition, can be a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic entry inhibitors without posing a biohazard to human beings.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Currently, studies are underway to assess the use of probiotics to improve rotavirus vaccine protection. A previous work demonstrated that the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 is able to hinder rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo. The present study takes a systematic approach in order to identify the molecule directly involved in rotavirus inhibition. Supernatant protease digestions revealed both the proteinaceous nature of the active substance and the fact that the molecule responsible for inhibiting rotavirus replication is released to the supernatant. Following purification by cationic exchange chromatography, active fractions were obtained and the functional compound was identified as an 11-amino acid peptide (MHQPHQPLPPT, named 11-mer peptide) with a molecular mass of 1.282 KDa. The functionality of 11-mer was verified using the synthesized peptide in Wa, Ito, and VA70 rotavirus infections of both HT-29 and MA-104 cell lines. Finally, protease activity was detected in B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 supernatant, which releases 11-mer peptide.

      "Error parsing: Background Inclusion of reusable respirators, such as elastomeric half-face respirators (EHFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), in hospital respiratory protection inventories may represent 1 solution to the problem of N95 respirator shortages experienced during pandemics. User acceptance of these devices is 1 potential barrier to implementing such a strategy in respiratory protection programs. Methods To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were compared between user groups. Results Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P < .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to “usual circumstance” scenarios. Conclusions Despite somewhat less favorable ratings on comfort and communication, experienced EHFR and PAPR users still prefer reusable respirators over N95s in certain higher risk scenarios. This suggests that reusable respirators are an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators in health care and offer 1 viable solution to prevent pandemic-generated respirator shortages.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Interferons (IFNs) contribute to cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity by inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In a screen to identify antiviral ISGs, we unexpectedly found that LY6E, a member of the LY6/uPAR family, enhanced viral infection. Here, we show that viral enhancement by ectopically expressed LY6E extends to several cellular backgrounds and affects multiple RNA viruses. LY6E does not impair IFN antiviral activity or signaling, but rather promotes viral entry. Using influenza A virus as a model, we narrow the enhancing effect of LY6E to uncoating after endosomal escape. Diverse mammalian orthologs of LY6E also enhance viral infectivity, indicating evolutionary conservation of function. By structure-function analyses, we identify a single amino acid in a predicted loop region that is essential for viral enhancement. Our study suggests that LY6E belongs to a class of IFN-inducible host factors that enhance viral infectivity without suppressing IFN antiviral activity.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Background/Purpose Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has a high fatality rate worldwide. We examined the epidemiologic and clinical factors associated with death for all laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in Taiwan. Methods Using initial data in medical records reported by hospitals to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, we analyzed whether hematological, biochemical and arterial blood gas measures could predict fatality in 346 SARS patients. Results Both fatalities (n = 73; 21.1%) and survivors had elevated plasma concentration of initial C-reactive protein (CRP), but the mean CRP concentration was higher in fatalities (47.7 ± 43.3 mg/L) than in survivors (24.6 ± 28.2 mg/L). Initial lymphocyte counts were low in both fatalities (814 ± 378/μL) and survivors (1019 ± 480/μL). After controlling for age and sex, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hematological factors significantly associated with fatality included initial neutrophil count > 7000/μL (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L (OR = 5.8) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) > 593.5 IU/L (OR = 4.2). Factors significantly associated with initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L included dyspnea (OR = 4.3), red blood cell count < 4.1 × 106/μL (OR = 4.3) and serum aspartate amino-transferase > 57 IU/L (OR = 3.1).

      "Error parsing: Abstract A novel clustering method is proposed to classify genes or genomes. This method uses a natural representation of genomic data by binary indicator sequences of each nucleotide (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)). Afterwards, the discrete Fourier transform is applied to these indicator sequences to calculate spectra of the nucleotides. Mathematical moments are calculated for each of these spectra to create a multidimensional vector in a Euclidean space for each gene or genome sequence. Thus, each gene or genome sequence is realized as a geometric point in the Euclidean space. Finally, pairwise Euclidean distances between these points (i.e. genome sequences) are calculated to cluster the gene or genome sequences. This method is applied to three sets of data. The first is 34 strains of coronavirus genomic data, the second is 118 of the known strains of Human rhinovirus (HRV), and the third is 30 bacteria genomes. The distance matrices are computed based on the three sets, showing the distances from each point to the others. We used the complete linkage clustering algorithm to build phylogenetic trees to indicate how the distances among these sequence correspond to the evolutionary relationship among these sequences. This genome representation provides a powerful and efficient method to classify genomes and is much faster than the widely acknowledged multiple sequence alignment method.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Houttuynia cordata Thunb. is a medicinal plant widely used in folk medicine in several Asian countries. It has been reported that a water extract of H. cordata exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Previous studies have demonstrated absolute requirement of NF-κB activation for efficient replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and inhibition of NF-κB activation has been shown to suppress HSV infection. Here we show that a hot water extract of H. cordata (HCWE) inhibits HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-κB activation. The IC50 was estimated at 50μg/ml of lyophilized HCWE powder. At 150 and 450μg/ml, HCWE blocked infectious HSV-2 production by more than 3 and 4 logs, respectively. The inhibitory activity was concomitant with an inhibition of NF-κB activation by HSV-2 infection. Although activation of NF-κB and Erk MAPK has been implicated for HSV replication and growth, HCWE showed no effect on HSV-2-induced Erk activation. Furthermore, we show that treatment with quercetin, quercitrin or isoquercitrin, major water extractable flavonoids from H. cordata, significantly blocked HSV-2 infection. These results together demonstrated that H. cordata blocks HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-κB activation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Objectives The cross-border transmission of infectious diseases is a worldwide public health issue. Current border screening measures are insufficiently sensitive. The study objectives were to describe the epidemiologic pattern of influenza infection among incoming travellers at Xiamen International Airport during nonpandemic periods and to assess the performance of a rapid influenza diagnostic test in border screening. Methods Between May 2015 and May 2016, travellers with influenza-like illnesses entering China at Xiamen International Airport were screened with a rapid test, Flu Dot-ELISA, and the collected specimens were further subjected to virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis. Results Of the 1 540 076 incoming travellers, 1224 cases of influenza-like illness were identified; 261 tested positive in the rapid test, and 176 were confirmed to be influenza through virus culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were demonstrated to be 96.6% (170/176) and 91.3% (957/1048), respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 65.1% (170/261) and 99.4% (957/963), respectively. The epidemiologic study indicated that H3N2 and (H1N1)pdm09 were dominant in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2016, an increased number of influenza B isolates and cocirculation of both Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses were observed, and mismatches between circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B Victoria lineage strains and vaccine strains also occurred. Conclusions We demonstrated the suitability and value of a high-sensitivity rapid influenza test in border screening and highlighted the importance of incoming travellers as a source of imported infectious diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Human corneal epithelial cells were challenged with WNV, incubated for 1–6 days, and tested for evidence of WNV infection. Viral RNA and antigen were detected at every time point, and the virus reached a peak titer of 2.5 × 10(7) plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL at 3 days postinoculation (PI). Corneas procured from donors were incubated in culture dishes containing WNV for 1–5 days and tested for evidence of WNV. Viral RNA and antigen were detected, and the virus reached a mean peak titer of 4.9 × 10(4) pfu/mL at 5 days PI. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with WNV, and their eyes were harvested at 2, 5, and 8 days PI and tested for evidence of WNV. Viral RNA was detected in corneas of four of nine systemically infected mice as early as 2 days PI. We conclude that human corneal cells support WNV replication in vitro and ex vivo, and WNV may disseminate into the corneas of experimentally infected mice. These findings indicate that corneal transmission cannot be ruled out as a novel mode of human-to-human WNV transmission and additional experiments should be conducted to assess this risk further.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In an effort to obtain further information on the characteristics of this virus, we have begun to sequence the viral RNA genome and to map the virion structural protein genes. A sequence of 1064 nucleotides, which represents the 3′ terminal end of the genome, was obtained from LDV cDNA clones. A 3′ noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region. The presence of overlapping ORFs and the 3′ terminal map position of Vpi indicate that LDV differs significantly from the prototype alpha togaviruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

It focuses particularly on the assembly of two types of enveloped viruses: (1) the beta herpesvirus—human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and (2) the primate lentiviruses—the simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (SIV and HIV). The chapter discusses the ways EM is used to identify morphological features of the various stages in the assembly of virus particles, to distinguish immature and mature particles, or to analyze steps involved in the acquisition of lipid membranes by enveloped viruses. In addition, it demonstrates the way immunolabeling allows the quantification of viral components, even in individual virus particles, and comparisons between particles at different locations in the cell or at different stages in viral assembly. Together with the newly developed methods for electron tomography and correlative immunofluorescence studies and EM, huge potential exists to unravel more details about virus assembly in the near future.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Many viruses globally shut off host gene expression to inhibit activation of cell-intrinsic antiviral responses. However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for development of new host-targeted antivirals.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Advances in pDNA delivery to host tissue with the employment of in vivo electroporation (EP) have led to significantly enhanced gene expression and the recent demonstration of clinical efficacy with the platform. Building upon this platform, this study reports that enzyme-mediated modification of the muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure at the site of pDNA delivery operates in a synergistic manner with EP to enhance both local and systemic gene expression further. Specifically, administration of chondroitinase ABC (Cho ABC) to the site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA led to transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier, permitting enhanced gene distribution and expression across the tissue. The employment of Cho ABC in combination with CELLECTRA(®) intramuscular EP resulted in increased gene expression by 5.5-fold in mice and 17.98-fold in rabbits. The study demonstrates how this protocol can be universally applied to an active prophylaxis platform to increase the in vivo production of functional immunoglobulin G, and to DNA vaccine protocols to permit drug dose sparing. The data indicate the Cho ABC formulation to be of significant value upon combination with EP to drive enhanced gene expression levels in pDNA delivery protocols.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples of both diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves from several countries worldwide. However, epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: The recent analysis of 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and their clinical characteristics, has given credence to stronger investments into hospital biopreparedness and overall infection prevention efforts.1 Within this analysis, researchers found two pieces that are particularly relevant to healthcare preparedness: first, that 26% of patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and second, that 41% of cases were related to healthcare transmission. Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcare‐associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARS‐CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Genomics analysis of a historically intriguing and predicted emergent human adenovirus (HAdV) pathogen, which caused pneumonia and death, provides insight into a novel molecular evolution pathway involving “ping-pong” zoonosis and anthroponosis. The genome of this promiscuous pathogen is embedded with evidence of unprecedented multiple, multidirectional, stable, and reciprocal cross-species infections of hosts from three species (human, chimpanzee, and bonobo). This recombinant genome, typed as HAdV-B76, is identical to two recently reported simian AdV (SAdV) genomes isolated from chimpanzees and bonobos. Additionally, the presence of a critical adenoviral replication element found in HAdV genomes, in addition to genes that are highly similar to counterparts in other HAdVs, reinforces its potential as a human pathogen. Reservoirs in nonhuman hosts may explain periods of apparent absence and then reemergence of human adenoviral pathogens, as well as present pathways for the genesis of those thought to be newly emergent. The nature of the HAdV-D76 genome has implications for the use of SAdVs as gene delivery vectors in human gene therapy and vaccines, selected to avoid preexisting and potentially fatal host immune responses to HAdV. IMPORTANCE An emergent adenoviral human pathogen, HAdV-B76, associated with a fatality in 1965, shows a remarkable degree of genome identity with two recently isolated simian adenoviruses that contain cross-species genome recombination events from three hosts: human, chimpanzee, and bonobo. Zoonosis (nonhuman-to-human transmission) and anthroponosis (human to nonhuman transmission) may play significant roles in the emergence of human adenoviral pathogens.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication. We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Known human coronaviruses (hCoV) usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, except SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which, in addition to mild illness can also be associated with severe respiratory diseases and high mortality rates. Well-characterized multiplexed serologic assays are needed to aid in rapid detection and surveillance of hCoVs. The present study describes development and evaluation of a multiplexed magnetic microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) to simultaneously detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific for recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (recN) from hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. We used paired human sera to screen for IgG with reactivity against six hCoVs to determine assay sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. We found no signal interference between monoplex and multiplex assay formats (R(2) range = 0.87–0.97). Screening of paired human sera using MMIA, resulted in 92 of 106 (sensitivity: 86%) as positive and 68 of 80 (specificity: 84%) as negative. This study serves as a proof of concept that it is feasible to develop and use a multiplexed microsphere immunoassay as a next generation screening tool for use in large scale seroprevalence studies of hCoVs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Annual influenza vaccination is routinely recommended for pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. However, there are limited data defining the immune response to the inactivated vaccine in this population. METHODS: This prospective study compared the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the trivalent subvirion influenza vaccine in pediatric liver transplant recipients with those in their healthy siblings. All subjects received inactivated influenza vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays for New Caledonia and Shanghai strains were performed at baseline, after each vaccine dose, and 3 months after the series. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titers; seroprotection was defined as an antibody titer ≥1:40. An increase in the number of T cells secreting IFN-γ was considered to be a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot response. RESULTS: After 1 dose of vaccine, transplant recipients achieved rates of antibody seroprotection and seroconversion that were similar to those achieved by their healthy siblings. However, for both influenza strains, IFN-γ responses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot were significantly attenuated in transplant recipients after 2 doses of vaccine. No cases of influenza or vaccine-related serious adverse events were documented in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The diminished cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination that was observed in pediatric liver transplant recipients suggests that the current vaccine strategy may not provide optimal protection. Because of concerns regarding potential emergence of more virulent influenza strains, further studies are warranted to determine if IFN-γ responses are predictive of efficacy and to identify the optimal vaccination strategy to protect populations with a high risk of infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

As the master regulator of the interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a central role in innate antiviral immunity. To explore the role of bat IRF7 in the regulation of the IFN response, we performed sequence and functional analysis of IRF7 from the pteropid bat, Pteropus alecto. Our results demonstrate that bat IRF7 retains the ability to bind to MyD88 and activate the IFN response despite unique changes in the MyD88 binding domain. We also demonstrate that bat IRF7 has a unique expression pattern across both immune and non-immune related tissues and is inducible by double-strand RNA. The broad tissue distribution of IRF7 may provide bats with an enhanced ability to rapidly activate the IFN response in a wider range of tissues compared to other mammals. The importance of IRF7 in antiviral activity against the bat reovirus, Pulau virus was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of IRF7 in bat cells resulting in enhanced viral replication. Our results highlight the importance of IRF7 in innate antiviral immunity in bats.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence exists that heavy metals modulate T helper cell (Th) responses and thereby elicit various pathological manifestation. Interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL-12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. RESULTS: Modulation of IL-12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-γ levels as well as to the Th1- or Th2-polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th1/Th2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL-12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. CONCLUSION: It can be inferred that: (i) IL-12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL-12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th1/Th2-associated immune disorders.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant MHV/BHK can infect hamster, rat, cat, dog, monkey, and human cell lines but not the swine testis (ST) porcine cell line (J. H. Schickli, B. D. Zelus, D. E. Wentworth, S. G. Sawicki, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 71:9499-9507, 1997). The spike (S) gene of MHV/BHK had 63 point mutations and a 21-bp insert that encoded 56 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert compared to the parental MHV strain A59. Recombinant viruses between MHV-A59 and MHV/BHK were selected in hamster cells. All of the recombinants retained 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert found in the N-terminal region of S of MHV/BHK, suggesting that these residues were responsible for the extended host range of MHV/BHK. Flow cytometry showed that MHV-A59 bound only to cells that expressed the murine glycoprotein receptor CEACAM1a. In contrast, MHV/BHK and a recombinant virus, k6c, with the 21 amino acid substitutions and 7-amino-acid insert in S bound to hamster (BHK) and ST cells as well as murine cells. Thus, 21 amino acid substitutions and a 7-amino-acid insert in the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein of MHV/BHK confer the ability to bind and in some cases infect cells of nonmurine species.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Methods Two cohorts of HCWs, the first serving Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and the second serving patients in Al-Ahsa, were investigated for respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and pathogen carriage using multiplex polymerase chain reaction before and after the 2015 Hajj. Results A total of 211 HCWs were enrolled of whom 92 were exposed to pilgrims (Mecca cohort), whereas 119 were not exposed (Al-Ahsa cohort). Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09). Gastrointestinal pathogens were rarely isolated in both cohorts of HCWs and acquisition of pathogens after the Hajj was documented in only a few individuals.

      "Error parsing: Betacoronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are important pathogens causing potentially lethal infections in humans and animals. Coronavirus RNA synthesis is thought to be associated with replication organelles (ROs) consisting of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. These are transformed into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) containing viral double-stranded RNA and into other membranous elements such as convoluted membranes, together forming a reticulovesicular network. Previous evidence suggested that the nonstructural proteins (nsp’s) 3, 4, and 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which contain transmembrane domains, would all be required for DMV formation. We have now expressed MERS-CoV replicase self-cleaving polyprotein fragments encompassing nsp3-4 or nsp3-6, as well as coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, to characterize the membrane structures induced. Using electron tomography, we demonstrate that for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 is required and sufficient to induce DMVs. Coexpression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 either as individual proteins or as a self-cleaving nsp3-4 precursor resulted in very similar DMVs, and in both setups we observed proliferation of zippered ER that appeared to wrap into nascent DMVs. Moreover, when inactivating nsp3-4 polyprotein cleavage by mutagenesis, we established that cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for MERS-CoV DMV formation. Addition of the third MERS-CoV transmembrane protein, nsp6, did not noticeably affect DMV formation. These findings provide important insight into the biogenesis of coronavirus DMVs, establish strong similarities with other nidoviruses (specifically, the arteriviruses), and highlight possible general principles in viral DMV formation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical significance of sterile- and microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic patients with a sonographic short cervix. METHODS: Amniotic fluid (AF) samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 231 asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix [cervical length (CL) ≤25 mm] were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anaerobic as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency and magnitude of intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin (IL)-6 concentration ≥2.6 ng/mL], acute histologic placental inflammation, spontaneous preterm delivery, and the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval were examined according to the results of AF cultures, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: Ten percent (24/231) of patients with a sonographic short cervix had sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (an elevated AF IL-6 concentration without evidence of microorganisms using cultivation and molecular methods). Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation was significantly more frequent than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation [10.4% (24/231) vs. 2.2% (5/231); p<0.001]. Patients with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous preterm delivery <34 weeks of gestation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 31.6% (55/174); p<0.001] and a significantly shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval than patients without intra-amniotic inflammation [median 35, (IQR: 10 – 70) vs. median 71, (IQR: 47 – 98) days, (p<0.0001)]. CONCLUSION: Sterile intra-amniotic inflammation is more common than microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation in asymptomatic women with a sonographic short cervix, and is associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (<34 weeks). Further investigation is required to determine the causes of sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and the mechanisms whereby this condition is associated with a short cervix and spontaneous preterm delivery.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The pharmacologic utility of lengthy peptides can be hindered by loss of bioactive structure and rapid proteolysis, which limits bioavailability. For example, enfuvirtide (Fuzeon, T20, DP178), a 36-amino acid peptide that inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by effectively targeting the viral fusion apparatus, has been relegated to a salvage treatment option mostly due to poor in vivo stability and lack of oral bioavailability. To overcome the proteolytic shortcomings of long peptides as therapeutics, we examined the biophysical, biological, and pharmacologic impact of inserting all-hydrocarbon staples into an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. We find that peptide double-stapling confers striking protease resistance that translates into markedly improved pharmacokinetic properties, including oral absorption. We determined that the hydrocarbon staples create a proteolytic shield by combining reinforcement of overall α-helical structure, which slows the kinetics of proteolysis, with complete blockade of peptide cleavage at constrained sites in the immediate vicinity of the staple. Importantly, double-stapling also optimizes the antiviral activity of HIV-1 fusion peptides and the antiproteolytic feature extends to other therapeutic peptide templates, such as the diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta). Thus, hydrocarbon double-stapling may unlock the therapeutic potential of natural bioactive polypeptides by transforming them into structurally fortified agents with enhanced bioavailability.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Background/purpose Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly discovered respiratory pathogen. This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method for investigating the epidemiology and diseases associated with hMPV. [J Formos Med Assoc 2007;106(1):16-24]: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The identity and high purity of compound 1 were confirmed by elemental analysis, NMR, IR analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound 1, evaluated in HepG 2.2.15 cells expressing permanently HBV, significantly reduced the levels of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. EC50 values were determined to be 54μM for HBeAg, 61μM for HBsAg and 2.66μM for supernatant HBV DNA, as compared to 1671, 1570, 169μM, respectively, for the commercially-available hepatitis B drug adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). Intracellular cccDNA, pgRNA and HBcAg were also found to be decreased by compound 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity results showed that compound 1 has low toxicity in HepG 2 cells with CC50 value of 515.20μM. The results indicate that compound 1 can efficiently inhibit HBV replication in HepG 2.2.15 cells line in vitro.

      "Error parsing: Abstract A basic problem for contemporary biology and medicine is exploring the correlation between human disease and underlying cellular mechanisms. For a long time, several efforts were made to reveal the similarity between embryo development and disease process, but few from the system level. In this article, we used the human protein–protein interactions (PPIs), disease genes with their classifications and embryo development genes and reconstructed a human disease-embryo development network to investigate the relationship between disease genes and embryo development genes. We found that disease genes and embryo development genes are prone to connect with each other. Furthermore, diseases can be categorized into three groups according to the closeness with embryo development in gene overlapping, interacting pattern in PPI network and co-regulated by microRNAs or transcription factors. Embryo development high-related disease genes show their closeness with embryo development at least in three biological levels. But it is not for embryo development medium-related disease genes and embryo development low-related disease genes. We also found that embryo development high-related disease genes are more central than other disease genes in the human PPI network. In addition, the results show that embryo development high-related disease genes tend to be essential genes compared with other diseases’ genes. This network-based approach could provide evidence for the intricate correlation between disease process and embryo development, and help to uncover potential mechanisms of human complex diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Objective We aimed to assess the effects of amoxicillin treatment in adult patients presenting to primary care with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who were infected with a potential bacterial, viral, or mixed bacterial/viral infection. Methods This multicentre randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0–6), and illness deterioration (reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analysed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral, or combined infection, and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, or blood urea nitrogen. Results 2058 patients (amoxicillin n = 1036; placebo n = 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n = 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n = 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n = 804) was reduced by 0.26 points (95% CI −0.48 to −0.03). The odds of illness deterioration (n = 2024) was 0.24 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.53) times lower from treatment with amoxicillin when both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were isolated (combined infection; n = 198). Conclusions Amoxicillin may reduce the risk of illness deterioration in patients with a combined bacterial and viral infection. We found no clinically meaningful benefit from amoxicillin treatment in other subgroups.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Sera from 38 free-ranging spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, were screened for exposure to coronavirus of antigenic group 1. An immunofluorescence assay indicated high levels of exposure to coronavirus among Serengeti hyenas: 95% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥1:10 and 74% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥1:40. Cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults. Exposure among Serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an ELISA. Application of RT-PCR to 27 fecal samples revealed viral RNA in three samples (11%). All three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals (<24 months of age) sampled, and none from the 12 adults sampled. No viral RNA was detected in tissue samples (lymph node, intestine, lung) from 11 individuals. Sequencing of two amplified products from the S protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific RNA with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type II of 80 and 84%, respectively. Estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in European, American and Japanese domestic cats and dogs. From long-term observations of several hundred known individuals, the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea. There was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coronavirus infection in Hyaenidae.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Sixty-two animals were inoculated intranasally on day 0 and 21 days later with approximately 10(2) median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the tenth passage of PRC replicated in L-2 cells. Animals were selected at random postvaccination to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRC by histopathology, immunohistochemistry and serology. At three and six months postvaccination (PV), vaccinated and seronegative control rats were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10(3) TCID50 doses of virulent SDA virus. Challenged rats were then killed at 6, 10 and 14 days postchallenge and necropsied. Evaluations were based on lesion indices in lacrimal and salivary glands and respiratory tract, the presence of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. Lesions were observed in rats killed PV, but in general, they were significantly reduced compared with those present in seronegative animals post-exposure to virulent SDA virus (p < or = 0.05). However, they were still considered to be an unacceptable level for a routine vaccination procedure. Potvaccination antibody titers to rat coronavirus were evident in all animals tested at three or six months prior to challenge with SDA virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS): Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis that mostly affects children below the age of 5. The vasculitis involves arteries of medium size, especially the coronaries. Various etiologies have been proposed including association with micro-organisms, bacterial superantigens, and genetic factors, however, the exact cause remains unknown. There is no specific laboratory test for KD. Diagnosis is clinical and depends upon the presence of fever for ≥5 days and 4 or more of five principal features, viz. polymorphous exanthem, extremity changes, mucosal changes involving the lips and oral cavity, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, and unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. The term “incomplete KD” refers to the presence of fever and less than four principal clinical features. Recognition of this group of patients is important because it is usually seen in infants and risk of coronary abnormalities is increased probably because of delays in diagnosis. However, what appears to be “incomplete” at a given point of time may not actually be so because some of the features may have already subsided and others may evolve over time. Hence, a detailed dermatological examination is warranted in all cases, especially in incomplete KD, to ensure timely diagnosis. Although KD is a self-limiting disease in most patients, coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) including coronary dilatations and aneurysms may develop in up to 25% of untreated patients. CAAs are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with KD. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation and consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) along with aspirin. Despite treatment, some patients may still develop CAAs, and hence, long-term follow up is of utmost importance.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: In the past decade, Clostridium difficile has emerged as an important gut pathogen. Symptoms of C. difficile infection range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis, sometimes resulting in colectomy or death. The main virulence factors of C. difficile are toxin A and toxin B. Besides the genes encoding these toxins (tcdA and tcdB), the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) also contains genes encoding a sigma factor (tcdR) and a putative anti-sigma factor (tcdC). The important role of TcdR as a sigma factor for toxin expression is undisputed, whereas the role of TcdC as an anti-sigma factor, inhibiting toxin expression, is currently the subject of debate. To clarify the role of TcdC in toxin expression, we generated an isogenic ClosTron-based mutant of tcdC in Clostridium difficile strain 630Δ Erm (CT::tcdC) and determined the transcription levels of the PaLoc genes and the expression levels of the toxins in the wild type strain and the tcdC mutant strain. We found only minor differences in transcription levels of the PaLoc genes between the wild type and CT::tcdC strains and total toxin levels did not significantly differ either. These results suggest that in C. difficile 630Δerm TcdC is not a major regulator of toxin expression under the conditions tested.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The emergence of new virus strains coincides with a higher level of influenza-like illness (ILI), which is seen as a peak of a normal season. Monitoring the spread of an epidemic influenza in populations is a difficult and important task. Twitter is a free social networking service whose messages can improve the accuracy of forecasting models by providing early warnings of influenza outbreaks. In this study, we have examined the use of information embedded in the Hangeul Twitter stream to detect rapidly evolving public awareness or concern with respect to influenza transmission and developed regression models that can track levels of actual disease activity and predict influenza epidemics in the real world.

Methods We performed a multicenter case-control study in 36 hospitals, in 2010 in Spain. Hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and three matched controls (two hospital and one community control) per case were selected. The use of non-pharmacological measures seven days before the onset of symptoms (frequency of hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and handwashing after touching contaminated surfaces) was collected. Results We studied 813 cases hospitalized for influenza and 2274 controls. The frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.65) and >10 times (aOR=0.59) and handwashing after contact with contaminated surfaces (aOR=0.65) were protective factors and were dose-responsive (p<0.001). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers were associated with marginal benefits (aOR=0.82).

Hospital pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), norovirus, multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and Clostridium difficile persist in the healthcare environment for considerable lengths of time. Cleaning with both detergent and disinfectant-based regimens help control these pathogens in both routine and outbreak situations. The most important transmission risk comes from organisms on frequently handled items because hand contact with a contaminated site could deliver a pathogen to a patient. Cleaning practices should be tailored to clinical risk, near-patient areas and hand-touch-sites and scientifically evaluated for all surfaces and equipment in today’s hospitals.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: With the features of extremely high selectivity and efficiency in catalyzing almost all the chemical reactions in cells, enzymes play vitally important roles for the life of an organism and hence have become frequent targets for drug design. An essential step in developing drugs by targeting enzymes is to identify drug-enzyme interactions in cells. It is both time-consuming and costly to do this purely by means of experimental techniques alone. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of enzyme, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because three-dimensional structures of many enzymes are still unknown. Here, we reported a sequence-based predictor, called “iEzy-Drug,” in which each drug compound was formulated by a molecular fingerprint with 258 feature components, each enzyme by the Chou's pseudo amino acid composition generated via incorporating sequential evolution information and physicochemical features derived from its sequence, and the prediction engine was operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The overall success rate achieved by iEzy-Drug via rigorous cross-validations was about 91%.

Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 5 per group) were exposed for 4 d to each of the following 3 treatments: access to a new synthetic bone and ethanol gel for 1 h daily (treatment 1); a new bone was left in the cage for 24 h, with access to ethanol gel for 1 h daily (treatment 2); and both the bone and ethanol gel remained in the cage for 24 h (treatment 3). Average alcohol consumption over 4 d was 0.86 ± 0.13, 0.99 ± 0.13, and 5.19 ± 0.37 g/kg in the absence of the bone for treatments 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 1.00 ± 0.13, 0.620 ± 0.07, and 5.55 ± 0.38 g/kg with the bone for treatments 1, 2 and 3, respectively; none of these values differed significantly with regard to presence of the bone. During treatment 1, time spent with the synthetic bone was highest on the first 2 d, which altered the rate of ethanol consumption but not the total amount of ethanol consumed. During treatments 2 and 3, the rate and amount of ethanol consumption were comparable to basal levels. We conclude that adding an enrichment device that rats can chew and manipulate does not alter ethanol gel consumption.

Although deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections are rare, the excess mortality burden of influenza estimated from statistical models may more reliably quantify the impact of influenza in a population. Methods. We applied age-specific multiple linear regression models to all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in Hong Kong from 1998 through 2009. The differences between estimated mortality rates in the presence or absence of recorded influenza activity were used to estimate influenza-associated excess mortality. Results. The annual influenza-associated all-cause excess mortality rate was 11.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2–14.6) per 100 000 person-years. We estimated an average of 751 (95% CI, 488–990) excess deaths associated with influenza annually from 1998 through 2009, with 95% of the excess deaths occurring in persons aged ≥65 years. Most of the influenza-associated excess deaths were from respiratory (53%) and cardiovascular (18%) causes. Influenza A(H3N2) epidemics were associated with more excess deaths than influenza A(H1N1) or B during the study period. Conclusions. Influenza was associated with a substantial number of excess deaths each year, mainly among the elderly, in Hong Kong in the past decade.

      "Error parsing: The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

PBM from BALB/c mice, a strain in which MHV-3 infection results in fatal acute fulminant hepatitis, responds to the virus with a robust PCA response, whereas PBM from C3H/St mice, a strain which develops mild acute hepatitis followed by chronic hepatitis, only exhibit a modest PCA response. In contrast, PBM from A/J mice, a strain fully resistant to MHV-3, generate no increase in PCA above control levels. The induction phase of MHV-3 PCA is rapid, with an increase within 1-1.5 h, with maximum activity at 18h, and it precedes MHV-3 replication in either 17 CL1 cells, a fully permissive cell line, or in monocytes from these strains of mice. The PCA response of BALB/c PBM exceeds the response to any other known stimulus. No induction occurs upon direct stimulation of monocytes by MHV-3, but in the presence of lymphocyte collaboration, the PCA response is observed first at a lymphocyte:monocyte ratio of 2:1 and reaches a maximum as the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio approaches 4:1.

      "Error parsing: Paramyxovirus establishes an intimate and complex interaction with the host cell to counteract the antiviral responses elicited by the cell. Of the various pattern recognition receptors in the host, the cytosolic RNA helicases interact with viral RNA to activate the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and subsequent cellular interferon (IFN) response. On the other hand, viruses explore multiple strategies to resist host immunity. In this study, we found that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection induced MAVS degradation. Further analysis showed that NDV V protein degraded MAVS through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to inhibit IFN-β production. Moreover, NDV V protein led to proteasomal degradation of MAVS through Lys362 and Lys461 ubiquitin to prevent IFN production. Further studies showed that NDV V protein recruited E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 to polyubiquitinate and degrade MAVS. Compared with levels for wild-type NDV infection, V-deficient NDV induced attenuated MAVS degradation and enhanced IFN-β production at the late stage of infection. Several other paramyxovirus V proteins showed activities of degrading MAVS and blocking IFN production similar to those of NDV V protein. The present study revealed a novel role of NDV V protein in targeting MAVS to inhibit cellular IFN production, which reinforces the fact that the virus orchestrates the cellular antiviral response to its own benefit. IMPORTANCE Host anti-RNA virus innate immunity relies mainly on the recognition by retinoic acid-inducible gene I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 and subsequently initiates downstream signaling through interaction with MAVS. On the other hand, viruses have developed various strategies to counteract MAVS-mediated signaling. The mechanism for paramyxoviruses regulating MAVS to benefit their infection remains unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that the V proteins of NDV and several other paramyxoviruses target MAVS for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through E3 ubiquitin ligase RING-finger protein 5 (RNF5). MAVS degradation leads to the inhibition of the downstream IFN-β pathway and therefore benefits virus proliferation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of NDV evading host innate immunity and provides insight into the therapeutic strategies for the control of paramyxovirus infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

DNA fragments encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK- and BHK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected. Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-1 protease encoding region.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary This chapter illustrates central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a few representative examples that have a high potential of providing evidence. It may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim who has been exposed to a particular microorganism or by-product, such as a toxin. Considerable advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. These advances include sequencing, genomics, and microscopy. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For investigative and forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivoin a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: The genus Sapovirus belongs to the family Caliciviridae, and its members are common causative agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Some caliciviruses are known to use either terminal sialic acids or histo-blood group antigens as attachment factors and/or cell surface proteins, such as CD300lf, CD300ld, and junctional adhesion molecule 1 of tight junctions (TJs), as receptors. However, the roles of TJs and their proteins in sapovirus entry have not been examined. In this study, we found that porcine sapovirus (PSaV) significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular permeability early in infection of LLC-PK cells, suggesting that PSaV dissociates TJs of cells. This led to the interaction between PSaV particles and occludin, which traveled in a complex into late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Inhibition of occludin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific antibody, or a dominant-negative mutant significantly blocked the entry of PSaV. Transient expression of occludin in nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conferred susceptibility to PSaV, but only for a limited time. Although claudin-1, another TJ protein, neither directly interacted nor was internalized with PSaV particles, it facilitated PSaV entry and replication in the LLC-PK cells. We conclude that PSaV particles enter LLC-PK cells by binding to occludin as a coreceptor in PSaV-dissociated TJs. PSaV and occludin then form a complex that moves to late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. In addition, claudin-1 in the TJs opened by PSaV infection facilitates PSaV entry and infection as an entry factor. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses (SaVs) cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Although they replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, which are tightly sealed by apical-junctional complexes, such as tight junctions (TJs), the mechanisms by which SaVs hijack TJs and their proteins for successful entry and infection remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that porcine SaVs (PSaVs) induce early dissociation of TJs, allowing them to bind to the TJ protein occludin as a functional coreceptor. PSaVs then travel in a complex with occludin into late endosomes through Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Claudin-1, another TJ protein, does not directly interact with PSaV but facilitates the entry of PSaV into cells as an entry factor. This work contributes to our understanding of the entry of SaV and other caliciviruses into cells and may aid in the development of efficient and affordable drugs to treat SaV infections.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus is an important respiratory pathogen in chickens. The IBV S1 spike is a viral structural protein that is responsible for attachment to host receptors and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. To date, there is no experimentally determined structure for the IBV S1 spike. In this study, we sought to find a predicted tertiary structure for IBV S1 using I-TASSER, which is an automated homology modeling platform. We found that the predicted structures obtained were robust and consistent with experimental data. For instance, we observed that all four residues (38, 43, 63, and 68) that have been shown to be critical for binding to host tissues, were found at the surface of the predicted structure of Massachusetts (Mass) S1 spike. Together with antigenicity index analysis, we were also able to show that Ma5 vaccine has higher antigenicity indices at residues close to the receptor-binding region than M41 vaccine, thereby providing a possible mechanism on how Ma5 achieves better protection against challenge. Examination of the predicted structure of the Arkansas IBV S1 spike also gave insights on the effect of polymorphisms at position 43 on the surface availability of receptor binding residues. This study showcases advancements in protein structure prediction and contributes useful, inexpensive tools to provide insights into the biology of IBV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus from the Nidovirales order that causes reproductive failure and respiratory disease in pigs and poses a constant threat to the global pig industry. The PRRSV-encoded nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that is conserved throughout the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families. Previously, our research and that of others demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production through NendoU activity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we found that PRRSV nsp11 also inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity and subsequent transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Detailed analysis showed that nsp11 targeted interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), but not transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or STAT2, key molecules in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, the nsp11-IRF9 interaction impaired the formation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) in both nsp11-overexpressed and PRRSV-infected cells. Importantly, nsp11 mutations (H129A, H144A, and K173A) that ablate NendoU activity or its cell cytotoxicity also interacted with IRF9 and retained the ability to block IFN signaling, indicating that the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is independent of NendoU activity or cell cytotoxicity of nsp11. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 antagonizes type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9 via a NendoU activity-independent mechanism, and this report describes a novel strategy evolved by PRRSV to counteract host innate antiviral responses, revealing a potential new function for PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling. IMPORTANCE The nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) encoded by PRRSV nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a unique NendoU of nidoviruses that infect vertebrates; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of antinidovirus drugs. Previous studies have revealed that the NendoU of nidoviruses, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), acts as a type I interferon (IFN) antagonist. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that overexpression of PRRSV nsp11 also inhibits IFN signaling by targeting the C-terminal interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain of IRF9. This interaction impaired the ability of IRF9 to form the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and to act as a signaling protein of IFN signaling. Collectively, our data identify IRF9 as a natural target of PRRSV NendoU and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by an arterivirus to counteract innate immune signaling.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The SCF ubiquitin ligases target proteins for degradation by recruitment factors called F-box proteins(1, 2). We identified a bi-planar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate phosphodegron recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full length phosphorylated substrates by SCF(Cdc4). A crystal co-structure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts between the β-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 Å remote from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive new class of druggable target.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Beta interferon (IFN-β) is a major component of innate immunity in mammals, but information on the in vivo source of this cytokine after pathogen infection is still scarce. To identify the cell types responsible for IFN-β production during viral encephalitis, we used reporter mice that express firefly luciferase under the control of the IFN-β promoter and stained organ sections with luciferase-specific antibodies. Numerous luciferase-positive cells were detected in regions of La Crosse virus (LACV)-infected mouse brains that contained many infected cells. Double-staining experiments with cell-type-specific markers revealed that similar numbers of astrocytes and microglia of infected brains were luciferase positive, whereas virus-infected neurons rarely contained detectable levels of luciferase. Interestingly, if a mutant LACV unable of synthesizing the IFN-antagonistic factor NSs was used for challenge, the vast majority of the IFN-β-producing cells in infected brains were astrocytes rather than microglia. Similar conclusions were reached in a second series of experiments in which conditional reporter mice expressing the luciferase reporter gene solely in defined cell types were infected with wild-type or mutant LACV. Collectively, our data suggest that glial cells rather than infected neurons represent the major source of IFN-β in LACV-infected mouse brains. They further indicate that IFN-β synthesis in astrocytes and microglia is differentially affected by the viral IFN antagonist, presumably due to differences in LACV susceptibility of these two cell types.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The prevalence of the bovine torovirus (BToV) and its genetic characterization have been reported in North America, Europe and Japan. Therefore, this study examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of the BToV in a total of 645 diarrheic fecal samples from 629 Korean native beef calf herds using RT-PCR and nested PCR with the primer pairs specific to a part of the BToV membrane (M) gene. Overall, 19 (2.9%) out of 645 diarrheic samples from 19 herds (6.9%) tested positive for BToVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. A comparison of the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of a part of the BToV M gene (409bp) among the BToVs showed the Korean BToVs to have comparatively higher sequence homology to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. Generally, the Korean BToV strains clustered with the Japanese and Dutch BToV strains. However, the American and Italian BToV strains clustered on a separate major branch, suggesting that these are more distantly related to other known BToV strains. These results suggest that the BToV infections are sporadic in diarrheic calves in South Korea, and the Korean BToV strains are more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Reproductive losses in camelids are due to infertility, pregnancy loss, udder diseases and neonatal mortality caused by a variety of infectious diseases. Uterine infection and abortion represent the major complaint in camelid veterinary practice. The major infectious organisms in endometritis and metritis are E. coli and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. Abortion rates due to infectious diseases vary from 10% to more than 70% in some areas. Leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and chlamydiosis have been diagnosed as the major causes of abortion in llamas and alpacas. In camels, brucellosis and trypanosomiasis represent the major causes of infectious abortion in the Middle East and Africa. Mastitis is rare in South American camelids. The prevalence of subclinical udder infection in camels can reach very high proportions in dairy camels. Udder infections are primarily due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonatal mortality is primarily due to diarrhea following failure of passive transfer and exposure to E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Coccidia and Salmonella. This paper reviews the etio-pathogenesis of these causes of reproductive losses, as well as the major risk factors and strategies to prevent their occurrence.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary Background Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020. Methods We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Findings As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community. Funding None.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a worldwide public health threat. As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this article, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on Novel Corona Virus 2019 provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Commission (NHC), and DXY. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations has been made in order to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide information in order to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin containment activities.

      "Error parsing: During the processes of human population dispersal around the world over the past 50 000-100 000 years, along with associated cultural evolution and inter-population contact and conflict, there have been several major transitions in the relationships of Homo sapiens with the natural world, animate and inanimate. Each of these transitions has resulted in the emergence of new or unfamiliar infectious diseases.The three great historical transitions since the initial advent of agriculture and livestock herding, from ca. 10 000 years ago, occurred when: (i) early agrarian-based settlements enabled sylvatic enzootic microbes to make contact with Homo sapiens; (ii) early Eurasian civilizations (such as the Greek and Roman empires, China and south Asia) came into military and commercial contact, ca. 3000-2000 years ago, swapping their dominant infections; and (iii) European expansionism, over the past five centuries, caused the transoceanic spread of often lethal infectious diseases. This latter transition is best known in relation to the conquest of the Americas by Spanish conquistadores, when the inadvertent spread of measles, smallpox and influenza devastated the Amerindian populations.Today, we are living through the fourth of these great transitional periods. The contemporary spread and increased lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflect the combined and increasingly widespread impacts of demographic, environmental, behavioural, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology. Modern clinical medicine has, via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the use of hypodermic syringes, created new opportunities for microbes. These have contributed to the rising iatrogenic problems of hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and several other viral infections. Meanwhile, the injudicious use of antibiotics has been a rare instance of human action actually increasing 'biodiversity'.Another aspect of this fourth transition is that modern hyper-hygienic living restricts microbial exposure in early life. This, in the 1950s, may have contributed to an epidemic of more serious, disabling, poliomyelitis, affecting older children than those affected in earlier, more endemic decades. As with previous human-microbe transitions, a new equilibrial state may lie ahead. However, it certainly will not entail a world free of infectious diseases. Any mature, sustainable, human ecology must come to terms with both the need for, and the needs of, the microbial species that help to make up the interdependent system of life on Earth. Humans and microbes are not \"at war\"; rather, both parties are engaged in amoral, self-interested, coevolutionary struggle. We need to understand better, and therefore anticipate, the dynamics of that process.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Detection of infectious viral agents has been on the increase globally with the advent and usage of more sensitive and selective novel molecular techniques in the epidemiological study of viral diseases of economic importance to the swine industry. The observation is not different for the pig-infecting member of the subfamily Parvovirinae in the family Parvoviridae as the application of novel molecular methods like metagenomics has brought about the detection of many other novel members of the group. Surprisingly, the list keeps increasing day by day with some of them possessing zoonotic potentials. In the last one decade, not less than ten novel swine-infecting viruses have been added to the subfamily, and ceaseless efforts have been in top gear to determine the occurrence and prevalence of the old and new swine parvoviruses in herds of pig-producing countries worldwide. The story, however, is on the contrary on the African continent as there is presently a dearth of information on surveillance initiatives of the viruses among swine herds of pig-producing countries in the region. Timely detection and characterization of the viral pathogens is highly imperative for the implementation of effective control and prevention of its spread. This review therefore presents a concise overview on the epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses globally and also provides up-to-date highlights on the reported cases of the viral agents in the African sub-region.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Critical pertussis is characterized by severe respiratory failure, important leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, septic shock and encephalopathy. AIM: To describe the clinical course of critical pertussis, and identify predictors of death at the time of presentation for medical care. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective study conducted in children’s hospital Tunisian PICU between 01 January and 31 October 2013. Patients with critical pertussis confirmed by RT-PCR and requiring mechanical ventilation were included. Predictors of death were studied. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients was studied. Median age was 50 days. Mortality was 23%. Predictors risk of mortality were : high PRISM score (Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score) (p=0,007), shock (p=0,002), tachycardia (p=0,005), seizures (p=0,006), altered mental status (p=0,006), elevated WBC count (p=0,003) and hemodynamic support (p=0022). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance in comorbidity, pneumoniae, high pulmonary hypertension or exchange transfusion. Concomitant viral or bacterial co-infection was not related to poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Young infants are at high risk to have critical pertussis. Despite advances in life support and the treatment of organ failure in childhood critical illness, critical pertussis remains difficult to treat.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved post-translational modification affecting various biological processes including viral propagation. Ubiquitination has multiple effects on viral propagation, including viral genome uncoating, viral replication, and immune evasion. Ubiquitination of viral proteins is triggered by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, and the 26S proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins. The UPS is the primary cytosolic proteolytic machinery for the selective degradation of various forms of proteins including viral proteins, thereby limiting viral growth in host cells. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the UPS to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation. This review highlights our current knowledge on the different roles of the UPS during viral propagation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Inflammation may be maladaptive to the control of viral infection when it impairs interferon (IFN) responses, enhancing viral replication and spread. Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-α. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN-α response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-α/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-α, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN-α refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with the induction of USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

One of the hit compounds was (Z)-1-((5-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-6-methyl-4-thioxo-4,5-dihydrofuro[3,4- c ]pyridin-3(1H)-one (15a) with half-maximal effective concentrations of 17.4–21.1μM against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses without any cellular toxicity at 900μM. To investigate the structure–activity relationships, two dozens of the hit analogs were synthesized. Among them, 15g, 15j, 15q, 15s, 15t and 15x had anti-influenza viral activity comparable or superior to that of the initial hit. The anti-influenza viral compounds efficiently suppressed not only viral protein level of the infected cells but also production of viral progeny in the culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. Based on a mode-of-action study, they did not affect virus entry or RNA replication. Instead, they suppressed viral neuraminidase activity. This study is the first to demonstrate that dihydrofuropyridinones could serve as lead compounds for the discovery of alternative influenza virus inhibitors.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Identification of the full complement of genes and other functional elements in any virus is crucial to fully understand its molecular biology and guide the development of effective control strategies. RNA viruses have compact multifunctional genomes that frequently contain overlapping genes and non-coding functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences. Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements. Having previously tested this technique by experimental verification of discoveries in selected viruses, we now analyze sequence alignments for ∼700 RNA virus species to identify hundreds of such regions, many of which have not been previously described.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: AIM: Mycoplasma pulmonis (MP) remains potentially important rodent pathogen causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM) which may go undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic nature. In the present study, we carried out clinical, pathological, and molecular investigations of MP-induced MRM in a rat colony. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. Both the animals were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms and further sampled for histopathological, serological, and molecular investigations. Tracheal washing and infected lung tissue were collected during necropsy examination for DNA extraction. Molecular diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific primers. RESULT:: Classical symptoms of MP-associated respiratory tract infection were observed in only 2 of 36 infected animals, and most of the animals were found asymptomatic to the disease; however, all the animals were found to be carrier after necropsy and PCR assay. Gross and histopathological finding suggested severe congestion of the lungs along with suppurative and necrotizing pneumonia. The disease is confirmed by molecular diagnosis using species-specific primers in PCR assay. CONCLUSION: MRM may go undiagnosed due to asymptomatic nature. Detailed study of clinical symptoms, pathology, serology, and PCR-based molecular approach may aid in health monitoring and detection of MRM in a rodent colony reared for experimental purpose.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: In this study, we used pan RNA-seq analysis to reveal the ubiquitous existence of both 5′ and 3′ end small RNAs (5′ and 3′ sRNAs). 5′ and 3′ sRNAs alone can be used to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes at 1-bp resolution and identify new steady RNAs, which are usually transcribed from functional genes. Then, we provided a simple and cost effective way for the annotation of nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes and the identification of new steady RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using 5′ and 3′ sRNAs, the annotation of human mitochondrial was corrected and a novel ncRNA named non-coding mitochondrial RNA 1 (ncMT1) was reported for the first time in this study. We also found that most of human tRNA genes have downstream lncRNA genes as lncTRS-TGA1-1 and corrected the misunderstanding of them in previous studies. Using 5′, 3′, and intronic sRNAs, we reported for the first time that enzymatic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) cleavage and RNA interference (RNAi) might be involved in the RNA degradation and gene expression regulation of U1 snRNA in human. We provided a different perspective on the regulation of gene expression in U1 snRNA. We also provided a novel view on cancer and virus-induced diseases, leading to find diagnostics or therapy targets from the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family and its related pathways. Our findings pave the way toward a rediscovery of dsRNA cleavage and RNAi, challenging classical theories.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Regulated secretory proteins are thought to be sorted in the trans- Golgi network (TGN) via selective aggregation. The factors responsible for this aggregation are unknown. We show here that two widespread regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (granins), remain in an aggregated state when TGN vesicles from neuroendocrine cells (PC12) are permeabilized at pH 6.4 in 1-10 mM calcium, conditions believed to exist in this compartment. Permeabilization of immature secretory granules under these conditions allowed the recovery of electron dense cores. The granin aggregates in the TGN largely excluded glycosaminoglycan chains which served as constitutively secreted bulk flow markers. The low pH, high calcium milieu was sufficient to induce granin aggregation in the RER. In the TGN of pituitary GH4C1 cells, the proportion of granins conserved as aggregates was higher upon hormonal treatment known to increase secretory granule formation. Our data suggest that a decrease in pH and an increase in calcium are sufficient to trigger the selective aggregation of the granins in the TGN, segregating them from constitutive secretory proteins.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: O_LIPredicting infectious disease dynamics is a central challenge in disease ecology. Models that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we take advantage of the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex non-linear relationships with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing values. Our approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus.\\nC_LIO_LIOur modelling approach provided enhanced predictive performance compared to more traditional approaches, as well as new insights into disease risks in a wild population. We were able to efficiently capture and visualise strong non-linear patterns, as well as model complex interactions between variables in shaping exposure risk from CDV and feline parvovirus. For example, we found that lions were more likely to be exposed to CDV at a young age but only in low rainfall years.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen combined with our data calibration approach, our framework helped us to answer questions about risk of pathogen exposure which are difficult to address with previous methods. Our framework not only has the potential to aid in predicting disease risk in animal populations, but also can be used to build robust predictive models suitable for other ecological applications such as modelling species distribution or diversity patterns.\\nC_LI: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210–230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6–30, 31–55, 56–80, 81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230, 231–248 or 249–265 lack functions of IFN–β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230 or 231–248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: INTRODUCTION: Bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are the cause of respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants. The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 155 samples were collected. Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females. The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years. Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns. All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level. RESULTS: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey. This is the first report on their detection and molecular characterisation in ruminants in Turkey.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Short open reading frames within the 5' leader of some eukaryotic mRNAs are known to regulate the rate of translation initiation on the downstream open reading frame. By employing the polymerase chain reaction, we learned that the 5'-terminal 5 nt on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs were heterogeneous and hypervariable throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, termini giving rise to a common 33-nt intraleader open reading frame were selected. Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the primary pathogen of enzootic pneumonia, occurs worldwide and causes major economic losses to the pig industry. The organism adheres to and damages the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract. Affected pigs show chronic coughing, are more susceptible to other respiratory infections and have a reduced performance. Control of the disease can be accomplished in a number of ways. First, management practices and housing conditions in the herd should be optimized. These include all-in/all-out production, limiting factors that may destabilize herd immunity, maintaining optimal stocking densities, prevention of other respiratory diseases, and optimal housing and climatic conditions. Strategic medication with antimicrobials active against M. hyopneumoniae and, preferably, also against major secondary bacteria may be useful during periods when the pigs are at risk for respiratory disease. Finally, commercial bacterins are widely used to control M. hyopneumoniae infections. The main effects of vaccination include less clinical symptoms, lung lesions and medication use, and improved performance. However, bacterins provide only partial protection and do not prevent colonization of the organism. Different vaccination strategies (timing of vaccination, vaccination of sows, vaccination combined with antimicrobial medication) can be used, depending on the type of herd, the production system and management practices, the infection pattern and the preferences of the pig producer. Research on new vaccines is actively occurring, including aerosol and feed-based vaccines as well as subunit and DNA vaccines. Eradication of the infection at herd level based on age-segregation and medication is possible, but there is a permanent risk for re-infections.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Bats are known to harbor emerging RNA viruses. Recent studies have used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify various virus species, including DNA viruses that are harbored by bats; however, little is known about the nature of these potentially novel viruses. Here, we report the characterization of a novel herpesvirus isolated from an Indonesian pteropodid bat. The virus, tentatively named fruit bat alphaherpesvirus 1 (FBAHV1), has a double-stranded DNA genome of 149,459 bp. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that FBAHV1 is phylogenetically grouped with simplexviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Inoculation of FBAHV1 into laboratory mice caused a lethal infection. Virus infection was observed in lung, liver, and brain tissue. Serological and PCR screening revealed that fruit bats infected with FBAHV1 or its related virus are widely distributed in Indonesia. The identification of FBAHV1 makes a considerable contribution to our understanding of simplexviruses associated with bats. IMPORTANCE Bats are known to harbor emerging viruses, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, and filoviruses. Although alphaherpesviruses are disseminated in humans and other animals, there is little information about their distribution in bats. Here, we isolated a previously unknown alphaherpesvirus from an Indonesian fruit bat. Genome sequence analysis suggested that the virus is a member of the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which also includes common human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. FBAHV1 is the first bat-derived alphaherpesvirus whose complete genome has been sequenced.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to viruses from different families while controlling other experimental parameters. Murine models are commonly used to study the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and in vitro studies using murine cells provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis observed in vivo. We used microarray analysis to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to distinguish shared and virus-specific mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: GP64, the major envelope glycoprotein of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) budded virion, is important for host cell receptor binding and mediates low-pH-triggered membrane fusion during entry by endocytosis. In the current study, we examined the functional role of the AcMNPV GP64 transmembrane (TM) domain by replacing the 23-amino-acid GP64 TM domain with corresponding TM domain sequences from a range of viral and cellular type I membrane proteins, including Orgyia pseudotsugata MNPV (OpMNPV) GP64 and F, thogotovirus GP75, Lymantria dispar MNPV (LdMNPV) F, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) GP41, human CD4 and glycophorin A (GpA), and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor addition sequence. In transient expression experiments with Sf9 cells, chimeric GP64 proteins containing either a GPI anchor or TM domains from LdMNPV F or HIV-1 GP41 failed to localize to the cell surface and thus appear to be incompatible with either GP64 structure or cell transport. All of the mutant constructs detected at the cell surface mediated hemifusion (outer leaflet merger) upon low-pH treatment, but only those containing TM domains from CD4, GpA, OpMNPV GP64, and thogotovirus GP75 mediated pore formation and complete membrane fusion activity. This supports a model in which partial fusion (hemifusion) proceeds by a mechanism that is independent of the TM domain and the TM domain participates in the enlargement or expansion of fusion pores after hemifusion. GP64 proteins containing heterologous TM domains mediated virion budding with dramatically differing levels of efficiency. In addition, chimeric GP64 proteins containing TM domains from CD4, GpA, HA, and OpMNPV F were incorporated into budded virions but were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gp64 null virus, whereas those with TM domains from OpMNPV GP64 and thogotovirus GP75 rescued infectivity. These results show that in addition to its basic role in membrane anchoring, the GP64 TM domain is critically important for GP64 trafficking, membrane fusion, virion budding, and virus infectivity. These critical functions were replaced only by TM domains from related viral membrane proteins.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Using the parameterized SEIR model, we simulated the spread dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number(R) and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with slower increase of the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for sars-cov-2 led to the upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.

Population and methods. — 3,152 children aged under 16 years, admitted to the Paediatrics department of the University Hospital Centre of Poitiers from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1995 with ear, nose and throat (ENT) and/or respiratory symptoms were systematically investigated. One hundred and forty-five RH strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions of 87 boys and 58 girls (mean age: 20.3 months). Among these, 92 (63.4%) were less than 1 year of age. Bacteriological investigations were done for 29 patients when a concomitant bacterial infection was suspected. Results. RH infection rate was maximum before 1 year of age (median age: 6.5 months) and decreased with age. RH were isolated throughout the 3 years, with a first peak from February to April, and a second one in autumn. The main symptoms were sibilants (27.6%) and cough (24.1%). Sibilants were more frequently associated in children under 12 months of age (P = 0.01). Sometimes, ophthalmologic or digestive symptoms were present. Three children with respiratory distress were transferred to the reanimation ward. In addition, a RH strain was isolated from a child who died of sudden infant death. Thirty-four children (23.4%) were co-infected by one or several viruses; the most frequently detected were the respiratory syncytial virus (41.2%) and the adenoviruses (35.3%). Twenty-nine children were infected by two viruses and five by three. Associated bacterial infections were diagnosed in 23 children, especially conjunctivitis due to Haemophilus influenzae (21.7%).

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, implementation of special projects for major infectious diseases, interdisciplinary and international cooperation, exotic disease surveillance, and health education. These strategies and measures can serve as models for the surveillance and response to continuing threats from emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in other countries.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: OBJECTIVES: To analyse trends in mortality and causes of death among children aged under 5 years in Beijing, China between 1992 and 2015 and to forecast under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) for the period 2016–2020. METHODS: An entire population-based epidemiological study was conducted. Data collection was based on the Child Death Reporting Card of the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network. Trends in mortality and leading causes of death were analysed using the χ(2) test and SPSS 19.0 software. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was fitted to forecast U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 using the EViews 8.0 software. RESULTS: Mortality in neonates, infants and children aged under 5 years decreased by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17% from 1992 to 2015, respectively. However, the U5MR increased by 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities comprised the top five causes of death. The greatest, most rapid reduction was that of pneumonia by 92.26%, with an annual average rate of reduction of 10.53%. The distribution of causes of death differed among children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and sepsis were among the top five causes of death in children aged 28 days to 1 year and accident was among the top five causes in children aged 1–4 years. The U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88‰, 2.87‰, 2.90‰, 2.97‰ and 3.09‰ for the period 2016–2020, based on the predictive model. CONCLUSION: Beijing has made considerable progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs could show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. Future considerations for child healthcare include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. Specific preventative measures should be implemented for children of various age groups.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Advances in cancer therapy have focused attention on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1–7), and protects against diabetic renal injury. Soluble ACE2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear at high levels in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17″ (ADAM17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) had no effect on shedding. In cells maintained in 7.8 mM D-glucose, ACE2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) competitive inhibitor sotrastaurin, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-α and -β1-specific inhibitor Go6976, the PKC β1 and β2-specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-2,-8, and -9, or an inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI250423X) had no effect on basal ACE2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-δ reduced ACE2 shedding by 20%, while knockdown of PKC-ε was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-δ, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding. Targeting PKC-δ may preserve membrane-bound ACE2 in proximal tubule in disease states and diminish Ang II-stimulated adverse signaling.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute pneumonia and renal failure. The MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. To facilitate these efforts, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme by X-ray crystallography. The molecule consists of a ubiquitin-like domain and a catalytic core domain. The catalytic domain displays an extended right-hand fold with a zinc ribbon and embraces a solvent-exposed substrate-binding region. The overall structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro is similar to that of the corresponding SARS-CoV enzyme, but the architecture of the oxyanion hole and of the S3 as well as the S5 specificity sites differ from the latter. These differences are the likely reason for reduced in vitro peptide hydrolysis and deubiquitinating activities of the MERS-CoV PLpro, compared to the homologous enzyme from the SARS coronavirus. Introduction of a side-chain capable of oxyanion stabilization through the Leu106Trp mutation greatly enhances the in vitro catalytic activity of the MERS-CoV PLpro. The unique features observed in the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro should allow the design of antivirals that would not interfere with host ubiquitin-specific proteases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that caused a global outbreak in 2003. Research has shown that it is caused by a novel coronavirus. A series of cases is reported where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. Detection of ocular infection from tears using the PCR technique has been widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose infections for other viruses. Methods: This is a case series report from cases classified as probable or suspect SARS cases. Tear samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients who were suspected of having SARS in Singapore over a period of 12 days (7–18 April 2003), and analysed by PCR using protocols developed by the WHO network of laboratories. Results: Three patients with probable SARS (one female and two male patients) had positive results from their tear samples. Tear samples were used to confirm SARS in the female patient, who was positive only from her tears. The positive specimens were found in cases sampled early in their course of infection. Conclusions: This is the first case series reported with the detection of the SARS coronavirus from tears, and has important implications for the practice of ophthalmology and medicine. The ability to detect and isolate the virus in the early phase of the disease may be an important diagnostic tool for future patients and tear sampling is both simple and easily repeatable. Many healthcare workers are in close proximity to the eyes of patients and this may be a source of spread among healthcare workers and inoculating patients. Ophthalmic practices may need to change as more stringent barrier methods, appropriate quarantine, and isolation measures are vital when managing patients with SARS.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Nurses leaving their jobs and the profession are an issue of international concern, with supply-demand gaps for nurses reported to be widening. There is a large body of existing literature, much of which is already in review form. In order to advance the usefulness of the literature for nurse and human resource managers, we undertook an overview (review of systematic reviews). The aim of the overview was to identify high quality evidence of the determinants and consequences of turnover in adult nursing. METHODS: Reviews were identified which were published between 1990 and January 2015 in English using electronic databases (the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, CINAHL plus and SCOPUS) and forward searching. All stages of the review were conducted in parallel by two reviewers. Reviews were quality appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and their findings narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Nine reviews were included. We found that the current evidence is incomplete and has a number of important limitations. However, a body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with - at the individual level - nurse stress and dissatisfaction being important factors and -at the organisational level - managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight. The consequences of turnover are only described in economic terms, but are considered significant. CONCLUSIONS: In making a quality assessment of the review as well as considering the quality of the included primary studies and specificity in the outcomes they measure, the overview found that the evidence is not as definitive as previously presented from individual reviews. Further research is required, of rigorous research design, whether quantitative or qualitative, particularly against the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave.

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Polyadenylation influences many aspects of mRNA as well as viral RNA. variable polyadenylation at the 3' end have been reported in RNA viruses. It is interesting to identify the characteristic and potential role of 3' polyadenylation of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), which has been reported to contain two genomic RNAs with 3' poly(A) tails and caused severe disease on wheat in East Asia region. METHODS: 3' RACE was used to identify sequences of the 3′ end in WYMV RNAs from naturally infected wheat by WYMV. In vitro translation assay was performed to analyze effect of UTRs of WYMV with or without 3’polyadenylation on translation. In vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein were performed to evaluate effect of variable polyadenylation on replication. RESULTS: Variable polyadenylation in WYMV RNAs was identified via 3′ RACE. WYMV RNAs in naturally infected wheat in China simultaneously present with regions of long, short, or no adenylation at the 3' ends. The effects of variable polyadenylation on translation and replication of WYMV RNAs were evaluated. 5’UTR and 3’UTR of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2 synergistically enhanced the translation of the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene in in vitro WGE system, whereas additional adenylates had an oppositive effect on this enhancement on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV. Additional adenylates remarkably inhibited the synthesis of complementary strand from viral genome RNA during the in vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein. CONCLUSIONS: 3' end of WYMV RNAs present variable polyadenylation even no polyadenylation. 3' polyadenylation have opposite effect on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2. 3' polyadenylation have negative effect on minus-strand synthesis of WYMV RNA in vitro. Variable polyadenylation of WYMV RNAs may provide sufficient selection on the template for translation and replication.

      "Error parsing: AIM: To investigate whether luteolin, the major polyphenolic components of Lonicera japonica, has beneficial effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and to determine whether the protective mechanism involves anti-inflammatory effects on neutrophils. METHODS: ALI was induced with intratracheal instillation of LPS in mice. The level of ALI was determined by measuring the cell count and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Neutrophils were stimulated with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or LPS in vitro. Chemotaxis and superoxide anion generation were measured to evaluate neutrophil activation. The potential involvement of intracellular signaling molecules in regulating neutrophil activation was analyzed by using Western blot. RESULTS: LPS induced ALI in mice, as evidenced with leukocyte infiltration and protein leakage into the lungs. Luteolin attenuated LPS-induced leukocyte infiltration and protein extravasation. In cell studies, luteolin attenuated the fMLP-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst (IC(50) 0.2±0.1 μmol/L and 2.2±0.8 μmol/L, respectively), but had a negligible effect on superoxide anion generation during phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. Furthermore luteolin effectively blocked MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Akt phosphorylation in fMLP- and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that luteolin has beneficial effects against LPS-induced ALI in mice, and the attenuation of neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst by luteolin involves the blockade of MEK-, ERK-, and Akt-related signaling cascades.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Dengue causes significantly more human disease than any other arboviruses. It causes a spectrum of illness, ranging from mild self-limited fever, to severe and fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever, as evidenced by vascular leakage and multifactorial hemostatic abnormalities. There is no specific treatment available till date. Evidence shows that chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 and their receptor CXCR3 are involved in severity of dengue, but their genetic association with the susceptibility of vascular leakage during dengue infection has not been reported. We genotyped 14 common variants of these candidate genes in 176 patients infected with dengue. rs4859584 and rs8878 (CXCL10) were significantly associated with vascular permeability of dengue infection (P <0.05); while variants of CXCL11 showed moderate significance of association (P =0.0527). Haplotype blocks were constructed for genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 (5 and 7 common variants respectively). Haplotype association tests performed revealed that, “CCCCA” of gene CXCL10 and “AGTTTAC” of CXCL11 were found to be significantly associated with vascular leakage (P =0.0154 and 0.0366 respectively). In summary, our association study further strengthens the evidence of the involvement of CXCL10 and CXCL11 in the pathogenesis of dengue infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary This chapter describes the Tetraviridae family. The virions of the Betatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, of about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against NβV. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species. The virons of omegatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. Unlike viruses in the genus Betatetravirus, viruses in the genus Omegatetravirus have bipartite genomes. As with the betatetraviruses, omegatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and studies in tissue culture cells show that the HaSV replicase is localized within the cytoplasm and associates with membranes derived from the endocytic pathway.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Bats, unique among mammals with powered flight, have many species with the longest size-proportionate lifespan of all mammals. Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight. Heat shock protein (HSP), highly conserved master regulators of cell stress, expression was examined across tissues and various cell lines in bats. Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

Although, the World Health Organization declared the end of the outbreak early 2016, sporadic cases of EBOV infection have since been reported. Alisporivir is the most clinically advanced broad-spectrum antiviral that functions by targeting a host protein, cyclophilin A (CypA). A modest antiviral effect of alisporivir against contemporary (Makona) but not historical (Mayinga) EBOV strains was observed in tissue culture. However, this effect was not comparable to observations for an alisporivir-susceptible virus, the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus. Thus, EBOV does not depend on (CypA) for replication, in contrast to many other viruses pathogenic to humans.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Programmed −1 frameshifting, whereby the reading frame of a ribosome on messenger RNA is shifted in order to generate an alternate gene product, is often triggered by a pseudoknot structure in the mRNA in combination with an upstream slippery sequence. The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The survival probability in a group of individuals may evolve in time due to the influence of a time-varying covariate. In this paper we present a model-based approach allowing the estimation of the functional link between the survival probability and a time-varying covariate when data are grouped and time-period censored. The approach is based on an underlying model consisting in non-stationary Markov processes and describing the survival of individuals. The underlying model is aggregated in time and at the group level to handle the group structure of data and the censoring. The aggregation yields a generalized non-linear mixed model. Then, a Bayesian procedure allows the estimation of the model parameters and the description of the link between the survival probability and the time-varying covariate. This approach is applied in order to explore the relationship between the daily survival probability of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and their time-varying lengths (small mosquitofish die with a higher rate than large ones because they are more affected by predation, cannibalism and environmental stress).: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Throughout the rabies virus (RABV) infectious cycle, host-virus interactions define its capacity to replicate, escape the immune response, and spread. As phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism involved in most cellular processes, kinases represent a target of choice to identify host factors required for viral replication. A kinase and phosphatase small interfering RNA (siRNA) high-content screening was performed on a fluorescent protein-recombinant field isolate (Tha RABV). We identified 57 high-confidence key host factors important for RABV replication with a readout set at 18 h postinfection and 73 with a readout set at 36 h postinfection, including 24 common factors at all stages of the infection. Amongst them, gene clusters of the most prominent pathways were determined. Up to 15 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and effectors, including MKK7 (associated with Jun N-terminal protein kinase [JNK] signalization) and DUSP5, as well as 17 phosphatidylinositol (PI)-related proteins, including PIP5K1C and MTM1, were found to be involved in the later stage of RABV infection. The importance of these pathways was further validated, as small molecules Ro 31-8820 and PD 198306 inhibited RABV replication in human neurons. IMPORTANCE Rabies virus relies on cellular machinery for its replication while simultaneously evading the host immune response. Despite their importance, little is known about the key host factors required for rabies virus infection. Here, we focused on the human kinome, at the core of many cellular pathways, to unveil a new understanding of the rabies virus infectious cycle and to discover new potential therapeutic targets in a small interfering RNA screening. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol metabolism were identified as prominent factors involved in rabies virus infection, and those findings were further confirmed in human neurons. While bringing a new insight into rabies virus biology, we also provide a new list of host factors involved in rabies virus infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: We have investigated the localization of Kex1p, a type I transmembrane carboxypeptidase involved in precursor processing within the yeast secretory pathway. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of Kex1p in a punctate organelle resembling the yeast Golgi apparatus as identified by Kex2p and Sec7p (Franzusoff, A., K. Redding, J. Crosby, R. S. Fuller, and R. Schekman. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 112:27- 37). Glycosylation studies of Kex1p were consistent with a Golgi location, as Kex1p was progressively N-glycosylated in an MNN1- dependent manner. To address the basis of Kex1p targeting to the Golgi apparatus, we examined the cellular location of a series of carboxy- terminal truncations of the protein. The results indicate that a cytoplasmically exposed carboxy-terminal domain is required for retention of this membrane protein within the Golgi apparatus. Deletions of the retention region or overproduction of wild-type Kex1p led to mislocalization of Kex1p to the vacuolar membrane. This unexpected finding is discussed in terms of models involving either the vacuole as a default destination for membrane proteins, or by endocytosis to the vacuole following their default localization to the plasma membrane.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Registration of interventional trials of Food and Drug Administration–regulated drug and biological products and devices became a legal requirement in 2007; the vast majority of these trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov offers an opportunity to define the clinical research landscape; here we analyze 10 years of infectious disease (ID) clinical trial research. METHODS: Beginning with 166 415 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007–2017, ID trials were selected by study conditions and interventions. Relevance to ID was confirmed through manual review, resulting in 13 707 ID trials and 152 708 non-ID trials. RESULTS: ID-related trials represented 6.9%–9.9% of all trials with no significant trend over time. ID trials tended to be more focused on treatment and prevention, with a focus on testing drugs, biologics, and vaccines. ID trials tended to be large, randomized, and nonblinded with a greater degree of international enrollment. Industry was the primary funding source for 45.2% of ID trials. Compared with the global burden of disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and hepatitis C trials were overrepresented, and lower respiratory tract infection trials were underrepresented. Hepatitis C trials fluctuated, keeping with a wave of new drug development. Influenza vaccine trials peaked during the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the most comprehensive characterization of ID clinical trials over the past decade. These results help define how clinical research aligns with clinical need. Temporal trends reflect changes in disease epidemiology and the impact of scientific discovery and market forces. Periodic review of ID clinical trials can help identify gaps and serve as a mechanism to realign resources.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection by sensing dsRNA produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the translation factor eIF2, halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or translational level because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicate that the degradation occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together these results suggest that an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR activity, and it has only been described in six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it.\\n\\nImportanceThe first line of defense in cells during viral infection is the innate immune system, which is activated by different viral products. PKR is a part of this innate immune system and is induced by interferon and activated by dsRNA produced by DNA and RNA viruses. PKR is such an important part of the antiviral response that many viral families have gene products to counteract its activation or the resulting effects of its activity. Although a few RNA viruses degrade PKR, this method of counteracting PKR has not been reported for any DNA viruses. MAV-1 does not encode virus-associated RNAs, a human adenoviral defense against PKR activation. Instead, MAV-1 degrades PKR, and it is the first DNA virus reported to do so. The innate immune evasion by PKR degradation is a previously unidentified way for a DNA virus to circumvent the host antiviral response.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract In order to test the hypothesis that a putative co-factor for the development of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in pigs could be of viral origin, we performed extensive virological examinations on organ material from pigs diagnosed with PMWS originating from within a Danish PMWS-transmission study. Virus isolation attempts were carried out on a large panel of different cell types including primary pig kidney cells and lung macrophages, primary rabbit kidney cells and seven established cell lines (MARC-145, ST117, PK15, BHK21, HeLa, Vero, and MDCK). Although these represent cells with susceptibility to a wide range of known viruses, the results did not provide evidence for a specific virus other than PCV2 contributing to the development of PMWS. Furthermore, in order to test whether specific genotypes of PCV2 may trigger the switch from PCV2 infection to clinical disease, we compared complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2 derived from PMWS-positive as well as PMWS-negative pigs. On the basis of the DNA sequences, the PCV2 isolates were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisting of one isolate originating from a herd unaffected by PMWS, with group 2 consisting of nine isolates originating from four PMWS-affected herds, four PMWS-positive pigs plus one unaffected herd. The PCV2 genomes from the two groups showed 95.5% identity. Alignment analyses of the sequences encoding the replicase and capsid protein from group 1 and group 2 PCV2 isolates showed two amino acid differences encoded in the replicase protein, while 19 amino acid differences were predicted among the capsid protein sequences. The PCV2 DNA sequence analysis supports recent observations from studies in USA as well as Europe, which suggest that strain variations may influence the clinical outcome of PCV2 infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of spleen cells from BALB/c (H-2d) mice immunized with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) was stimulated in vitro for 7 days. CTL were tested for recognition of target cells infected with either JHMV or vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the four virus structural proteins. Only target cells infected with either JHMV or the vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the JHMV nucleocapsid protein were recognized. Cytotoxic T cell lines were established by limiting dilution from the brains of mice undergoing acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis after infection with JHMV. Twenty of the 22 lines recognized JHMV-infected but not uninfected syngeneic target cells, indicating that they are specific for JHMV. All T-cell lines except one were CD8+. The specificity of the CTL lines was examined by using target cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the JHMV nucleocapsid, spike, membrane, and hemagglutinin-esterase structural proteins. Seventeen lines recognized target cells expressing the nucleocapsid protein. Three of the JHMV-specific T-cell lines were unable to recognize target cells expressing any of the JHMV structural proteins, indicating that they are specific for an epitope of a nonstructural protein(s) of JHMV. These data indicate that the nucleocapsid protein induces an immunodominant CTL response. However, no CTL activity specific for the nucleocapsid protein could be detected in either the spleens or cervical lymph nodes of mice 4, 5, 6, or 7 days after intracranial infection, suggesting that the CTL response to JHMV infection within the central nervous system may be induced or expanded locally.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injection of Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin 1h before intranasal instillation (i.n.) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and interleukin (IL)-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin–eosin, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue and lung wet/dry weight ratios were observed. Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway activation and the phosphorylation of IκBα protein were determined by Western blot analysis. Prime-O-glucosylcimifugin showed promising anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: In many countries, the predominant field isolates of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been classified as QX-like strains since 1996. However, no commercial vaccines that are specific for this type of IBV are currently available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel vaccines that prevent QX-like IBV infection. RESULTS: A recombinant Marek’s disease virus (MDV), rMDV-S1, that expresses the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein from the QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was constructed by inserting the IBV S1 gene into the genome of the CVI988/Rispens strain of MDV. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were vaccinated with rMDV-S1 were protected when challenged with the QX-like IBV. They were observed to have mild clinical signs of disease, a short virus-shedding period and low mortality. Additionally, the rMDV-S1 conferred full protection to chickens against virulent MDV, as did the CVI988/Rispens strain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that rMDV-S1 is an effective and promising recombinant vaccine for the prevention of QX-like IBV infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Recent studies have described several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that recognize glycan-dependent epitopes (GDEs) in the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120. These were recovered from HIV-1 infected subjects, and several (e.g., PG9, PG16, CH01, CH03) target glycans in the first and second variable (V1/V2) domain of gp120. The V1/V2 domain is thought to play an important role in conformational masking, and antibodies to the V1/V2 domain were recently identified as the only immune response that correlated with protection in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial. While the importance of antibodies to polymeric glycans is well established for vaccines targeting bacterial diseases, the importance of antibodies to glycans in vaccines targeting HIV has only recently been recognized. Antibodies to GDEs may be particularly significant in HIV vaccines based on gp120, where 50% of the molecular mass of the envelope protein is contributed by N-linked carbohydrate. However, few studies have reported antibodies to GDEs in humans or animals immunized with candidate HIV-1 vaccines. In this report, we describe the isolation of a mouse mAb, 4B6, after immunization with the extracellular domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp140. Epitope mapping using glycopeptide fragments and in vitro mutagenesis showed that binding of this antibody depends on N-linked glycosylation at asparagine N130 (HXB2 numbering) in the gp120 V1/V2 domain. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to natural HIV-1 infection, immunization with recombinant proteins can elicit antibodies to the GDEs in the V1/V2 domain of gp120. Although little is known regarding conditions that favor antibody responses to GDEs, our studies demonstrate that these antibodies can arise from a short-term immunization regimen. Our results suggest that antibodies to GDEs are more common than previously suspected, and that further analysis of antibody responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein will lead to the discovery of additional antibodies to GDEs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

A decentralized and fragmented health system, such as the one found in China, is not well-suited to making a rapid and coordinated response to public health emergencies. The commercial orientation of the health sector on the supply-side and lack of health insurance coverage on the demand-side further exacerbate the problems of the under-provision of public services, such as health surveillance and preventive care. For the past 25 years, the Chinese Government has kept economic development at the top of the policy agenda at the expense of public health, especially in terms of access to health care for the 800 million people living in rural areas. A significant increase in government investment in the public health infrastructure, though long overdue, is not sufficient to solve the problems of the health-care system. China needs to reorganize its public health system by strengthening both the vertical and horizontal connections between its various public health organizations. China's recent policy of establishing a matching-fund financed rural health insurance system presents an exciting opportunity to improve people's access to health care.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

With the exception of the highly pathogenic SARS and MERS coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1) circulate worldwide and typically cause the common cold. In most cases, infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease, although acute infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Importantly, no drugs against human coronaviruses exist, and only supportive therapy is available. Previously, we proposed the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and its hydrophobically-modified derivative (HM-HTCC) as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Here, we show that HTCC inhibits interaction of a virus with its receptor and thus blocks the entry. Further, we demonstrate that HTCC polymers with different degrees of substitution act as effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract Protecting boar studs and their clients from emerging infectious disease first involves effective biosecurity measures to keep a disease out that was not present, and second, early identification and ceasing semen distribution prior to disseminating infectious disease. Experiences in the field can best guide us as to what has been effective. Circumstances in North America in the period of 1999–2004 resulted in numerous PRRS virus (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) negative boar studs becoming infected and disseminating virus to sow farms. Earlier detection methods were needed, and withholding of semen pending negative test results became standard. To accomplish this, diagnostic labs complied with industry requests for same day testing. At the same time, research efforts helped clarify the major routes of PRRS virus introduction into the farms. The risk of fomites and aerosol spread became viewed as major risks. Addressing issues with people and supply entry alone did not eliminate new virus entry. The implementation of air filtration during 2005–2008 had a major impact on the rate of new virus introductions into boar studs after other measures alone were unsuccessful. Risks exposed with the introduction of PED virus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea) into North America further highlighted other risk factors such as feed ingredients, trailer sanitation, and the presence of clear physical barriers. The successful adaptation of testing procedures, combined with biosecurity procedures including air filtration, has made the incidence of infectious disease introduction extremely rare in North American boar studs over the last decade. While survivability of infectious disease agents can vary in different materials or in the air, successful protocols should be applied and adjusted as needed to accommodate new information or risks. Cleary defined physical barriers for people and animal entry and exit, sanitization and/or down time on incoming supplies, risk mitigation and testing of feed ingredients, and filtration have been keys to changing the incidence of emerging infectious disease introduction into boar studs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Traditionally, MS has been considered a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the central white matter in which ensuing demyelination results in physical disability. Recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the central nervous system leads to permanent neurological and clinical disability. In this article, we discuss the latest developments on MS research, including etiology, pathology, genetic association, EAE animal models, mechanisms of neuronal injury and axonal transport, and therapeutics.

      "Error parsing: Over the past three decades, a powerful array of techniques has been developed for expressing heterologous proteins and saccharides on the surface of bacteria. Surface-engineered bacteria, in turn, have proven useful in a variety of settings, including high-throughput screening, biofuel production, and vaccinology. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of methods for displaying polypeptides and sugars on the bacterial cell surface, and discuss the many innovative applications these methods have found to date. While already an important biotechnological tool, we believe bacterial surface display may be further improved through integration with emerging methodology in other fields, such as protein engineering and synthetic chemistry. Ultimately, we envision bacterial display becoming a multidisciplinary platform with the potential to transform basic and applied research in bacteriology, biotechnology, and biomedicine.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In the present study, the antitumor activity of a herbal product derived from the Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) was examined, using in vitro assays in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. Results showed that S. baicalensis root extract at the concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in human OSCC cell lines, while not affecting the adhering abilities of cells. This suggested that it did not alter the expression of any of the adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The S. baicalensis root extract demonstrated potent cytostatic and apoptotic effects due to the downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and its partner cyclin D1, resulting in G1 arrest and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, the S. baicalensis root extract was found to have blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation in human endothelial cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that as a herbal product, the S. baicalensis root extract is a potential inhibitor of tumori- and angiogenesis and may be valuable in the development of pharmaceutical medications for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Recent epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a leading cause of pediatric diarrhea with particularly grave impact on infants and immunocompromised individuals. There is neither a vaccine nor effective treatment. We establish a drug discovery process built on scalable phenotypic assays and mouse models that takes advantage of transgenic parasites. Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity we identified pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis. Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in potent reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice. Treatment also leads to rapid resolution of diarrhea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection. Our results suggest the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K as a target for pyrazolopyridines and warrant further preclinical evaluation of KDU731 as a drug candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

It is also now widely recognized that outcomes for patients cared for in specialist CF Centres are better than for those who are not. Key to the effectiveness of the specialist CF Centre is the multidisciplinary team (MDT), which should include consultants, clinical nurse specialist, microbiologist, physiotherapist, dietitian, pharmacist, clinical psychologist, social worker, clinical geneticist and allied healthcare professionals, all of whom should be experienced in CF care. Members of the MDT are also expected to keep up to date with developments in CF through continued professional development, attendance at conferences, auditing and involvement in research. Specialists CF Centres should also network with other Centres both nationally and internationally, and feed Centre data to registries in order to further the understanding of the disease.

      "Error parsing: Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. \\\"Nowcast\\\" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission--that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases--and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package \\\"NobBS\\\") for widespread application.\\n\\nSignificanceAchieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. However, approaches that seek to estimate cases in spite of reporting delays often do not consider the temporal relationship between cases during an outbreak, nor do they identify characteristics of robust approaches that generalize to a wide range of surveillance contexts with very different reporting delays. Here, we present a smooth Bayesian nowcasting approach that produces accurate estimates that capture the time evolution of the epidemic curve and outperform a previous approach in the literature. We assess the performance for two diseases to identify important features of the reporting delay distribution that contribute to the models performance and robustness across surveillance settings.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major respiratory pathogens. Coinfection with RSV and S. pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if interaction between RSV and pneumococci enhances pneumococcal virulence. Methods: We used confocal microscopy and Western blot to identify the receptors involved in direct binding of RSV and pneumococci, the effects of which were studied in both in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Human ciliated respiratory epithelial cell cultures were infected with RSV for 72 hours and then challenged with pneumococci. Pneumococci were collected after 2 hours exposure and changes in gene expression determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements and Main Results: Following incubation with RSV or purified G protein, pneumococci demonstrated a significant increase in the inflammatory response and bacterial adherence to human ciliated epithelial cultures and markedly increased virulence in a pneumonia model in mice. This was associated with extensive changes in the pneumococcal transcriptome and significant up-regulation in the expression of key pneumococcal virulence genes, including the gene for the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We show that mechanistically this is caused by RSV G glycoprotein binding penicillin binding protein 1a. Conclusions: The direct interaction between a respiratory virus protein and the pneumococcus resulting in increased bacterial virulence and worsening disease outcome is a new paradigm in respiratory infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The 2014/15 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the inherent weaknesses associated with the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR). In this perspective article, the lessons learnt from the outbreak are used to review the challenges impeding effective implementation of the IHR and to propose policy and strategic options for enhancing its application. While some progress has been achieved in implementing the IHR in several countries, numerous challenges continue to impede its effectiveness, especially in developing countries, such as those affected by the West Africa EVD outbreak. Political and economic sensitivities associated with reporting public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), inadequate resources (human and financial), and lack of technical know-how required for implementation of the IHR are weaknesses that continue to constrain the implementation of the regulations. In view of the complex sociopolitical, cultural, and public health dimensions of PHEICs, frameworks, such as the IHR, which have legal backing, seem to be the most effective and sustainable option for assuring timely detection, notification, and response to such events. Renewed efforts to strengthen national and global institutional frameworks for implementation of the IHR are therefore required. Improvements in transparency, commitment, and accountability of parties to the IHR, mainstreaming of the IHR into national public health governance structures, use of multidisciplinary approaches, and mobilization of the required resources for the implementation of the IHR are imperative.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes severe pneumonia with a fatal outcome in approximately 10% of patients. SARS-CoV is not closely related to other coronaviruses but shares a similar genome organization. Entry of coronaviruses into target cells is mediated by the viral S protein. We functionally analyzed SARS-CoV S using pseudotyped lentiviral particles (pseudotypes). The SARS-CoV S protein was found to be expressed at the cell surface upon transient transfection. Coexpression of SARS-CoV S with human immunodeficiency virus-based reporter constructs yielded viruses that were infectious for a range of cell lines. Most notably, viral pseudotypes harboring SARS-CoV S infected hepatoma cell lines but not T- and B-cell lines. Infection of the hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was also observed with replication-competent SARS-CoV, indicating that hepatocytes might be targeted by SARS-CoV in vivo. Inhibition of vacuolar acidification impaired infection by SARS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes, indicating that S-mediated entry requires low pH. Finally, infection by SARS-CoV S pseudotypes but not by vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotypes was efficiently inhibited by a rabbit serum raised against SARS-CoV particles and by sera from SARS patients, demonstrating that SARS-CoV S is a target for neutralizing antibodies and that such antibodies are generated in SARS-CoV-infected patients. Our results show that viral pseudotyping can be employed for the analysis of SARS-CoV S function. Moreover, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV infection might not be limited to lung tissue and can be inhibited by the humoral immune response in infected patients.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The aim of this study was to establish a combined in silico and in vitro approach to assess feline leukocyte production of IFN-γ in response to selected peptides of the nucleocapside protein (N) of FCoVs. To this aim, we designed, through a bioinformatic approach, 8 potentially immunogenic peptides from the protein N corresponding to sequences of residues 14, 182, 198 detected only in FCoVs from FIP cats (virulent strains), only in FCoVs from healthy cats (avirulent strains) and both in FIP and in healthy cats (mixed strains). The peptides or a sham solution were incubated with whole blood from 16 cats (7 healthy and 9 with chronic diseases other than FIP) and IFN-γ concentration was measured on plasma using an ELISA system. RT-PCR expression of IFN-γ mRNA was also evaluated after incubation of the peptides or a sham solution with whole blood from 4 clinically healthy cats. The mean plasma concentration of IFN-γ in samples incubated with peptides decreased and the expression of IFN-γmRNA did not change compared with the sham solution, except for some cats with chronic diseases (which probably have a “pre-activated” immune response). These cats responded to “avirulent” or “mixed” peptides by increasing the concentration of IFN-γ and the expression of IFN-γ mRNA. The combined approach employed in this study allowed us to identify potentially immunogenic peptides of FCoV N protein that can modulate the production of IFN-γ especially in cats with a “pre-activated” cell mediated response.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus plays a vital role in virus maturation and is proposed to be a key target for drug design against SARS. Various in vitro studies revealed that only the dimer of the matured 3CL(pro) is active. However, as the internally encoded 3CL(pro) gets matured from the replicase polyprotein by autolytic cleavage at both the N-terminal and the C-terminal flanking sites, it is unclear whether the polyprotein also needs to dimerize first for its autocleavage reaction. We constructed a large protein containing the cyan fluorescent protein (C), the N-terminal flanking substrate peptide of SARS 3CL(pro) (XX), SARS 3CL(pro) (3CLP), and the yellow fluorescent protein (Y) to study the autoprocessing of 3CL(pro) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In contrast to the matured 3CL(pro), the polyprotein, as well as the one-step digested product, 3CLP-Y-His, were shown to be monomeric in gel filtration and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. However, dimers can still be induced and detected when incubating these large proteins with a substrate analog compound in both chemical cross-linking experiments and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. We also measured enzyme activity under different enzyme concentrations and found a clear tendency of substrate-induced dimer formation. Based on these discoveries, we conclude that substrate-induced dimerization is essential for the activity of SARS-3CL(pro) in the polyprotein, and a modified model for the 3CL(pro) maturation process was proposed. As many viral proteases undergo a similar maturation process, this model might be generally applicable.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

      "Error parsing: To determine the incidence of anogenital warts (AGWs) in the Chinese general population, we compared the data from a prospective study and from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS). A cohort study including 2378 women and 2309 men aged 18–55 years old enrolled from Liuzhou, China, was conducted with three scheduled visits at 6-month intervals from May 2014 to March 2016. And, a questionnaire survey was performed to collect the diagnosis history of AGWs at the enrollment visit. The data on reported AGW cases of Liuzhou in the NNDRS from 2006 to 2015 were also analyzed. Overall, the incidence rates of AGWs in the prospective study, in the self-reported diagnosis during past 12 months and in the NNDRS were 1.26 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16–2.37), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.17–4.20) and 0.183 (95% CI: 0.178–0.187), respectively. Human papillomavirus 6 or 11 were found in all the AGW biopsy samples (10/10). The onset time of AGWs in women was earlier, and the cumulative risk increased more quickly at a young age along with each subsequent younger birth cohort (P<0.0001), whereas slight differences were observed in the different male birth cohorts (P=0.0785). The sexual behavior of individuals and their sexual partners had a strong relationship with self-reported AGWs. Our study indicates that the incidence of AGWs in China is as high as that in developed countries, and the data based on the national surveillance system seriously underestimate the real disease burden of AGWs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant swine diseases worldwide. Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 μg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1–200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces. RESULTS: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera from PRRSV-positive and PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of PRRSV infection in weaning piglets. Furthermore, SELDI-TOF protein markers represent a refined phenotype of PRRSV infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Polysaccharides are natural biopolymers that have been recognized to be the most promising hosts for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) because of their outstanding biocompatible and biodegradable properties. Polysaccharides are diverse in size and molecular chains, making them suitable for the reduction and stabilization of MNPs. Considerable research has been directed toward investigating polysaccharide-based metallic nanoparticles (PMNPs) through host–guest strategy. In this review, approaches of preparation, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, are presented and compared. Different characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering are discussed in detail. Besides, the applications of PMNPs in the field of wound healing, targeted delivery, biosensing, catalysis and agents with antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer capabilities are specifically highlighted. The controversial toxicological effects of PMNPs are also discussed. This review can provide significant insights into the utilization of polysaccharides as the hosts to synthesize MPNs and facilitate their further development in synthesis approaches, characterization techniques as well as potential applications.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: In preliminary studies feeding the poorly absorbed carbohydrate sorbitol at 2.3 g/kg body weight as an indication of maximal fermentative capacity failed to produce the expected large increase in breath hydrogen excretion but did produce a transient diarrhea in five out of six control calves. Twelve healthy control and eighteen diarrheic calves were fed lactose or D-xylose on consecutive days at 1.15 g/kg body weight and a concentration of 46 g/L. Breath and blood samples were collected at 1 h intervals from 0 to 7 h. After administration of lactose, there was a significant increase in breath hydrogen excretion in diarrheic versus control calves. The increase in plasma glucose concentrations was delayed in diarrheic calves but the area under the absorption curve was similar in control and diarrheic calves. After administration of D-xylose, breath hydrogen excretion did not increase significantly but plasma D-xylose concentrations were significantly reduced in diarrheic calves. The pathogens commonly isolated from the feces were Cryptosporidium species, rotavirus and coronavirus. The number of pathogens and the severity of the calves' acid-base deficit were not related to the severity of carbohydrate malabsorption. Decreased absorption of lactose and D-xylose may be the result of intestinal villous atrophy caused by viral or parasite infection. It was concluded that carbohydrate malabsorption rather than a specific lactose maldigestion is a significant problem in diarrheic calves. Diarrheic calves appear to digest and absorb lactose when fed in small amounts.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: 25%-50% of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) cases remain etiologically undiagnosed. Our main aim was to determine the most appropriate list of enteric pathogens to be included in the daily diagnostics scheme of AGE, ensuring the lowest possible diagnostic gap. METHODS: 297 children ≤6 years of age, admitted to hospital in Slovenia, October 2011 – October 2012, with AGE, and 88 ≤6 year old healthy children, were included in the study. A broad spectrum of enteric pathogens was targeted with molecular methods, including 8 viruses, 6 bacteria and 2 parasites. RESULTS: At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 91.2% of cases with AGE and 27.3% of controls. Viruses were the most prevalent (82.5% and 15.9%), followed by bacteria (27.3% and 10.2%) and parasites (3.0% and 1.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. A high proportion (41.8%) of mixed infections was observed in the cases. For cases with undetermined etiology (8.8%), stool samples were analyzed with next generation sequencing and a potential viral pathogen was detected in 17 additional samples (5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that tests for rotaviruses, noroviruses genogroup II, adenoviruses 40/41, astroviruses, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella sp. should be included in the initial diagnostic algorithm, which revealed the etiology in 83.5% of children tested. The use of molecular methods in diagnostics of gastroenteritis is preferable because of their high sensitivity, specificity, fast performance and the possibility of establishing the concentration of the target. The latter may be valuable for assessing the clinical significance of the detected enteric, particularly viral pathogens.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

This study evaluated the differences in health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care provided to patients with unexplained fever before and after global budget (GB) implementation in Taiwan. The National Health Insurance Research Database was used for analyzing the health care expenditures and quality of care before and after implementation of the GB system. Patients diagnosed as having unexplained fever during 2000–2001 were recruited; their 2000–2001 and 2004–2005 data were considered baseline and postintervention data, respectively. Data of 259 patients with unexplained fever were analyzed. The mean lengths of stay (LOSs) before and after GB system implementation were 4.22 ± 0.35 days and 5.29 ± 0.70 days, respectively. The mean costs of different health care expenditures before and after implementation of the GB system were as follows: the mean diagnostic, drug, therapy, and total costs increased respectively from New Taiwan Dollar (NT$) 1440.05 ± NT$97.43, NT$3249.90 ± NT$1108.27, NT$421.03 ± NT$100.03, and NT$13,866.77 ± NT$2,114.95 before GB system implementation to NT$2224.34 ± NT$238.36, NT$4272.31 ± NT$1466.90, NT$2217.03 ± NT$672.20, and NT$22,856.41 ± NT$4,196.28 after implementation.

      "Error parsing: Bats have been identified as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like and SARS coronaviruses (SLCoV and SCoV). However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The 2014 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa has presented a significant public health crisis to the international health community and challenged US emergency departments to prepare for patients with a disease of exceeding rarity in developed nations. With the presentation of patients with Ebola to US acute care facilities, ethical questions have been raised in both the press and medical literature as to how US emergency departments, emergency physicians, emergency nurses and other stakeholders in the healthcare system should approach the current epidemic and its potential for spread in the domestic environment. To address these concerns, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Emergency Nurses Association and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine developed this joint position paper to provide guidance to US emergency physicians, emergency nurses and other stakeholders in the healthcare system on how to approach the ethical dilemmas posed by the outbreak of EVD. This paper will address areas of immediate and potential ethical concern to US emergency departments in how they approach preparation for and management of potential patients with EVD.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 × 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: RNA helicases of the DEAD-box protein family form the largest group of helicases. The human DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays an important role in tRNA and mRNA processing, is involved in tumor progression and is also hijacked by several virus families such as HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export. Although important in many cellular processes, the mechanism of DDX1′s enzymatic function is unknown. We have performed equilibrium titrations and transient kinetics to determine affinities for nucleotides and RNA. We find an exceptional tight binding of DDX1 to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), one of the strongest affinities observed for DEAD-box helicases. ADP binds tighter by three orders of magnitude when compared to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), arresting the enzyme in a potential dead-end ADP conformation under physiological conditions. We thus suggest that a nucleotide exchange factor leads to DDX1 recycling. Furthermore, we find a strong cooperativity in binding of RNA and ATP to DDX1 that is also reflected in ATP hydrolysis. We present a model in which either ATP or RNA binding alone can partially shift the equilibrium from an ‘open’ to a ‘closed’-state; this shift appears to be not further pronounced substantially even in the presence of both RNA and ATP as the low rate of ATP hydrolysis does not change.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Wet markets are markets selling fresh meat and produce. Wet markets are critical for food security and sustainable development in their respective regions. Due to their cultural significance, they attract numerous visitors and consequently generate tourist-geared information on the Web (ie, on social networks such as TripAdvisor). These data can be used to create a novel, international wet market inventory to support epidemiological surveillance and control in such settings, which are often associated with negative health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using social network data, we aimed to assess the level of wet markets’ touristic importance on the Web, produce the first distribution map of wet markets of touristic interest, and identify common diseases facing visitors in these settings. METHODS: A Google search was performed on 31 food market–related keywords, with the first 150 results for each keyword evaluated based on their relevance to tourism. Of all these queries, wet market had the highest number of tourism-related Google Search results; among these, TripAdvisor was the most frequently-occurring travel information aggregator, prompting its selection as the data source for this study. A Web scraping tool (ParseHub) was used to extract wet market names, locations, and reviews from TripAdvisor. The latter were searched for disease-related content, which enabled assignment of GeoSentinel diagnosis codes to each. This syndromic categorization was overlaid onto a mapping of wet market locations. Regional prevalence of the most commonly occurring symptom group - food poisoning - was then determined (ie, by dividing the number of wet markets per continent with more than or equal to 1 review containing this syndrome by the total number of wet markets on that continent with syndromic information). RESULTS: Of the 1090 hits on TripAdvisor for wet market, 36.06% (393/1090) conformed to the query’s definition; wet markets were heterogeneously distributed: Asia concentrated 62.6% (246/393) of them, Europe 19.3% (76/393), North America 7.9% (31/393), Oceania 5.1% (20/393), Africa 3.1% (12/393), and South America 2.0% (8/393). Syndromic information was available for 14.5% (57/393) of wet markets. The most frequently occurring syndrome among visitors to these wet markets was food poisoning, accounting for 54% (51/95) of diagnoses. Cases of this syndrome were identified in 56% (22/39) of wet markets with syndromic information in Asia, 71% (5/7) in Europe, and 71% (5/7) in North America. All wet markets in South America and Oceania reported food poisoning cases, but the number of reviews with syndromic information was very limited in these regions (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: The map produced illustrates the potential role of touristically relevant social network data to support global epidemiological surveillance. This includes the possibility to approximate the global distribution of wet markets and to identify diseases (ie, food poisoning) that are most prevalent in such settings.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Nosocomial transmission is an important characteristic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Risk factors for transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings are not well defined. During the Korean outbreak in 2015, 186 patients had laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Those suspected as a source of viral transmission were categorized into the spreader groups (super-spreader [n = 5] and usual-spreader [n = 10]) and compared to the non-spreader group (n = 171). Body temperature of ≥ 38.5°C (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–22.30; P = 0.016), pulmonary infiltration of ≥ 3 lung zones (aOR, 7.33; 95% CI, 1.93–27.79; P = 0.003), and a more nonisolated in-hospital days (aOR, 1.32 per 1 day; 95% CI, 1.09–1.60; P = 0.004) were significant risk factors in the spreader group. There was no different clinical factor between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders. Nonisolated in-hospital days was the only factor which tended to be higher in super-spreaders than usual-spreaders (Mean, 6.6 vs. 2.9 days; P = 0.061). Early active quarantine might help reducing the size of an outbreak.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: RNA interference is a promising strategy for treatment of Huntington’s disease (HD) as it can specifically decrease the expression of the mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt). However, siRNA does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore delivery to the brain is limited to direct CNS delivery. Non-invasive delivery of siRNA through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) would be a significant advantage for translating this therapy to HD patients. Focused ultrasound (FUS), combined with intravascular delivery of microbubble contrast agent, was used to locally and transiently disrupt the BBB in the right striatum of adult rats. 48 hrs following treatment with siRNA, the right (treated) and left (control) striatum was dissected and analyzed for Htt mRNA levels. We demonstrate that FUS can non-invasively deliver siRNA-Htt directly to the striatum leading to a significant reduction of Htt expression in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that reduction of Htt with siRNA-Htt was greater when the extent of BBB disruption was increased. This study demonstrates that siRNA treatment for knockdown of mutant Htt is feasible without the surgical intervention previously required for direct delivery to the brain.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Objectives Transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) strains have been described in CF and may be associated with a poorer prognosis. The “Prairie Epidemic Strain” (PES) has been recently identified in up to 30% of patients at prairie-based CF centres, however, its clinical impact remains to be determined. Methods A cohort study of adults with cystic fibrosis from 1981–2014 was conducted and all PA isolates from clinical visits were prospectively collected. PA strain typing at clinic enrolment, and most recent was conducted by PFGE. Patients were divided into one of four cohorts: no PA, transient PA, unique chronic PA, and chronic PES. Random effects and proportional Cox hazard models were conducted for outcome of death, transplantation and FEV1% decline. Results 204 patients (54% male) with CF were analysed: 38 no PA, 20 transient PA, 103 unique PA, 43 PES. Baseline FEV1% was lowest in the chronic PES group (p = 0.002). Overall rate of FEV1% decline was –1.19%/year (95% CI: –1.41 to –0.97, p<0.001); the chronic PES group had the greatest rate of decline at –1.24%/year (p<0.001). There were a total of 42 deaths and 37 transplants through 1862 and 2050 follow-up years, respectively. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not different for the PA groups compared to the no PA group. Relative to the no PA group, risk of transplant was increased in those with chronic PES (HR 9.13, CI 1.29–69, p = 0.032) compared to the no PA group. Conclusion Chronic PES infection is significantly associated with a greater rate of FEV1% decline and risk of lung transplantation but not with increased risk of death compared to no PA infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary Aims We undertook this study to define the incidence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in our hospital and to characterise the isolates. Methods All unformed stool was tested for the presence of Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), and cultured for C. difficile. Culture filtrates were also tested for TcdA and TcdB. Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A2B+ strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A-B+. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L. Thirty-three had PCR ribotype B, of which only one (3%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L. The 14 A-B+ strains were all PCR ribotype C, and had a range of MICs for clindamycin from 2 to >256mg/L. Conclusions: The incidence of CDAD in our hospital is relatively low. Isolates remain susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The lung is constantly exposed to a large volume of inhaled air that may contain toxicant xenobiotics. With the possibility of exposure to a variety of respiratory toxicants from airborne pollutants in our environment during the course of daily activities, in occupational settings, the use of aerosol sprays for household products, and the development of inhalant bronchial therapies, pulmonary toxicology has become an important subspecialty of toxicology. The lung is susceptible to injury following hematogenous exposure to toxicants. Susceptibility to injury and the type of response following exposure to air- or blood-borne toxicants is largely dependent on the physiochemical characteristics and concentration of the toxicant, duration of exposure, site/tissue specific sensitivity, and the integrity of the defense mechanisms of the lung. In this chapter, nonneoplastic and neoplastic spontaneous lesions and those that develop in the lungs of rats following exposure to toxicants by various routes, but primarily by inhalation, are discussed in detail which provides insight into our understanding of how human lungs respond to toxic chemicals. In addition, the gross and microscopic anatomy of the rat lung is also discussed some detail. Although inhalation is the primary route of exposure in experimental studies, in the past, many studies used intratracheal instillation or direct injection of known carcinogens into the lung. These experiments often resulted in the development of squamous cell carcinomas even though they are very rare as a naturally occurring neoplasm. Instillation of chemicals or particles into the trachea or pleura or direct injection into the lung results in lesions or responses that may not be as relevant to understanding the mechanism of pulmonary carcinogenesis as inhalation of materials under more normal conditions. There remain, however, many areas where our understanding of the response of the lung to toxic chemicals is incomplete.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background Who should be tested for viruses in patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), prevalence and risk factors for viral CAP are still debated. We evaluated the frequency of viral testing, virus prevalence, risk factors and treatment coverage with oseltamivir in patients admitted for CAP. Methods Secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of hospitalized adults with CAP. Testing frequency, prevalence of viral CAP and treatment with oseltamivir were assessed among patients who underwent a viral swab. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to evaluate risk factors. Results 553 (14.9%) patients with CAP underwent nasal swab. Viral CAP was diagnosed in 157 (28.4%) patients. Influenza virus was isolated in 80.9% of cases. Testing frequency and viral CAP prevalence were inhomogeneous across the participating centers. Obesity (OR 1.59, 95%CI: 1.01–2.48; p = 0.043) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.62, 95%CI: 1.02–2.56; p = 0.040) were independently associated with viral CAP. Prevalence of empirical treatment with oseltamivir was 5.1%. Conclusion In an international scenario, testing frequency for viruses in CAP is very low. The most common cause of viral CAP is Influenza virus. Obesity and need for invasive ventilation represent independent risk factors for viral CAP. Adherence to recommendations for treatment with oseltamivir is poor.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: This case study is the first to be developed in the Middle East region to document what happened during the response to the 2013 MERS outbreak in Qatar. It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis & Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially followed during the early days of the MERS-CoV epidemic, which were characterized by overwhelming uncertainty. The SCH’s commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy since day one, contributed to creating the SCH’s image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of the overall response efforts. Yet, conflicting messages and over reassurance were among the observed pitfalls of the implemented ERC strategy. Conclusion: The adoption of CERC principles can help restore and maintain the credibility of responding agencies. Further work is needed to develop more rigorous and comprehensive research strategies that address sharing of information by mainstream as well as social media for a more accurate assessment of the impact of the ERC strategy.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine, characterized by severe vomiting, diarrhea, and high mortality. Currently, the vaccines for it are only partially effective and no specific drug is available for treatment of TGE virus (TGEV) infection. RNA interference has been confirmed as a new approach for controlling viral infections. In this study, the inhibitory effect of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the ORF 7 gene of TGEV on virus replication was examined. RESULTS: Four theoretically effective sequences of TGEV ORF 7 gene were designed and selected for construction of shRNA expression plasmids. In the reporter assays, three of four shRNA expression plasmids were able to inhibit significantly the expression of ORF 7 gene and replication of TGEV, as shown by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of viral ORF 7 and N genes and detection of virus titers (TCID(50)/ml). Stable swine testicular (ST) cells expressing the shRNAs were established. Observation of the cytopathic effect and apoptosis, as well as a cell proliferation assay demonstrated that the three shRNAs were capable of protecting ST cells against TGEV destruction, with high specificity and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that plasmid-transcribed shRNAs targeting the ORF 7 gene in the TGEV genome effectively inhibited expression of the viral target gene and viral replication in vitro. These findings provide evidence that the shRNAs have potential therapeutic application for treatment of TGE.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We report the in utero transmission of Mycoplasma pulmonis and the development of placentitis, amnionitis, and mild fetal bronchopneumonia in Sprague-Dawley rats. A minimum of 10 days prior to breeding, specific-pathogen-free female Sprague-Dawley rats were infected by intravaginal inoculation with 3 x 10(7) CFU of M. pulmonis X1048 or with an equal volume of sterile broth. Rats and fetuses were subjected to necropsy at days 11, 14, and 18 of gestation. M. pulmonis was able to invade the placenta, cross the placental barrier, and establish an amniotic fluid infection by gestational day 14. It was isolated from the oropharynx and lungs of fetuses at gestational day 18. The placenta was more frequently colonized than amniotic fluid, followed by the fetal oropharynx and lungs, supporting an ascending route of infection. Histopathological evidence also support an active infection, with lesions compatible with placentitis, amnionitis, and mild fetal bronchopneumonia. M. pulmonis can traverse the placenta, resulting in infection of the amniotic fluid and in utero transmission of the microorganism to the developing fetus.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Autophagy is an important metabolic mechanism that can promote cellular survival following injury. The specific contribution of autophagy to silica-induced inflammation and disease is not known. The objective of these studies was to determine the effects of silica exposure on the autophagic pathway in macrophages, as well as the general contribution of autophagy in macrophages to inflammation and disease. Silica exposure enhanced autophagic activity in vitro in Bone Marrow derived Macrophages and in vivo in Alveolar Macrophages isolated from silica-exposed mice. Impairment of autophagy in myeloid cells in vivo using Atg5(fl/fl)LysM-Cre(+) mice resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity and inflammation after silica exposure compared to littermate controls, including elevated IL-18 and the alarmin HMGB1 in the whole lavage fluid. Autophagy deficiency caused some spontaneous inflammation and disease. Greater silica-induced acute inflammation in Atg5(fl/fl)LysM-Cre(+) mice correlated with increased fibrosis and chronic lung disease. These studies demonstrate a critical role for autophagy in suppressing silica-induced cytotoxicity and inflammation in disease development. Furthermore, this data highlights the importance of basal autophagy in macrophages and other myeloid cells in maintaining lung homeostasis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

After we had noted Sjögren's syndrome in several patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a virus also excreted in saliva, we set up a prospective study to investigate the association of chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis, with or without symptoms, to chronic HCV liver disease. The histological appearances of labial salivary glands in patients with proven HCV hepatitis or cirrhosis were compared with those in dead controls. Histological changes characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome were significantly more common in HCV-infected patients (16 of 28, 57%) compared with controls (1 of 20, 5%). Focal lymphocytic sialadenitis characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome (though only 10 patients had xerostomia and none complained of xerophthalmia) appears to be common in patients with chronic HCV liver disease; if this association is confirmed, identification of the underlying mechanism may improve our understanding of both disorders.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Orthoreoviruses infect virtually all mammalian species, causing systemic infections including mild gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. However, little is known about the prevalence or genetic diversity of porcine orthoreoviruses in South Korea. We examined 237 diarrheic fecal samples collected from 78 pig farms around the country. RT-PCR utilizing primers specific for the L1 gene of mammalian orthoreoviruses showed that 45 (19.0%) samples were positive. The 10 strains isolated from orthoreovirus-positive samples formed typical perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and had an atypical hemagglutination pattern; these are characteristics of type 3 orthoreovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene in these 10 Korean and other strains showed that type 3 orthoreoviruses could be divided into four lineages; the 10 Korean strains were included in porcine lineage IV, along with T3/porcine/Sichuan/2006. Sequence analysis showed that strains in lineage IV had nucleotide identities of 97.0–98.1% and deduced amino acid identities of 96.4–98.2%. Sequence analysis of the σ1 protein, a viral attachment protein, revealed that the amino acid sequences associated with neurotropism (amino acids 198–204, 249I, 350D, and 419E) were highly conserved among the Korean strains, confirming that neural tropism was present. In conclusion, our findings suggest that porcine orthoreovirus infections are endemic in pig farms in South Korea and that the 10 novel Korean porcine orthoreoviruses belong to porcine lineage IV of type 3 orthoreovirus. In addition, sequence analysis of S1 genes encoding the σ1 protein showed that the 9 of 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses exhibited neural tropism.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The interactions occurring between a virus and a host cell during a viral infection are complex. The purpose of this paper was to analyze altered cellular protein levels in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)-infected swine testicular (ST) cells in order to determine potential virus-host interactions. A proteomic approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification was conducted on the TGEV-infected ST cells. The results showed that the 4-plex iTRAQ-based quantitative approach identified 4,112 proteins, 146 of which showed significant changes in expression 48 h after infection. At 64 h post infection, 219 of these proteins showed significant change, further indicating that a larger number of proteomic changes appear to occur during the later stages of infection. Gene ontology analysis of the altered proteins showed enrichment in multiple biological processes, including cell adhesion, response to stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cell motility, protein complex assembly, growth, developmental maturation, immune system process, extracellular matrix organization, locomotion, cell-cell signaling, neurological system process, and cell junction organization. Changes in the expression levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), caspase-8, and heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90α) were also verified by western blot analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first time the response profile of ST host cells following TGEV infection has been analyzed using iTRAQ technology, and our description of the late proteomic changes that are occurring after the time of vigorous viral production are novel. Therefore, this study provides a solid foundation for further investigation, and will likely help us to better understand the mechanisms of TGEV infection and pathogenesis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: A genome space is a moduli space of genomes. In this space, each point corresponds to a genome. The natural distance between two points in the genome space reflects the biological distance between these two genomes. Currently, there is no method to represent genomes by a point in a space without losing biological information. Here, we propose a new graphical representation for DNA sequences. The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method and prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. Using these moment vectors, we have constructed a novel genome space as a subspace in R(N). It allows us to show that the SARS-CoV is most closely related to a coronavirus from the palm civet not from a bird as initially suspected, and the newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 is more closely related to SARS than to any other known member of group 2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree for 34 lentiviruses (including human immunodeficiency virus) based on their whole genome sequences. Our genome space will provide a new powerful tool for analyzing the classification of genomes and their phylogenetic relationships.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The role of individual case characteristics, such as symptoms or demographics, in norovirus transmissibility is poorly understood. Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (REi) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of REi were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and REi were estimated using a multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated REis (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.74 (95% CI: 1.90, 3.94) more individuals than non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.62 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.41) more individuals than cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.69 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.42) more individuals than staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe majority of all norovirus outbreaks reported to the CDC occur in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), including nursing homes, where older residents are at risk for more severe or prolonged infection. Because there is currently no publicly available norovirus vaccine, sound control measures are key to controlling norovirus outbreaks, but there is little evidence that standard control measures are effective in reducing the size and/or duration of LTCF norovirus outbreaks. Hence, studies leading to a better understanding of disease spread and prevention of additional cases, and thus more effective control measures, are needed. To this end, we aimed to quantify factors associated with norovirus transmission and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. We show that vomiting and, to a lesser extent, diarrhea are critical in initiating and sustaining norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. We also show that nursing home residents, rather than staff, are the primary drivers of transmission. Results suggest that control measures focusing on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents, would be most effective at curtailing norovirus transmission in these settings.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS) is an illness-specific health-related quality-of-life questionnaire outcomes instrument. OBJECTIVES: Research questions were: 1) How well does the WURSS-21 assess the symptoms and functional impairments associated with common cold? 2) How well can this instrument measure change over time (responsiveness)? 3) What is the minimal important difference (MID) that can be detected by the WURSS-21? 4) What are the descriptive statistics for area under the time severity curve (AUC)? 5) What sample sizes would trials require to detect MID or AUC criteria? 6) What does factor analysis tell us about the underlying dimensional structure of the common cold? 7) How reliable are items, domains, and summary scores represented in WURSS? 8) For each of these considerations, how well does the WURSS-21 compare to the WURSS-44, Jackson, and SF-8? STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: People with Jackson-defined colds were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. Participants were enrolled within 48 hours of first cold symptom and monitored for up to 14 days of illness. Half the sample filled out the WURSS-21 in the morning and the WURSS-44 in the evening, with the other half reversing the daily order. External comparators were the SF-8, a 24-hour recall general health measure yielding separate physical and mental health scores, and the eight-item Jackson cold index, which assesses symptoms, but not functional impairment or quality of life. RESULTS: In all, 230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. Participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%), and represented substantive education and income diversity. WURSS-21 items demonstrated similar performance when embedded within the WURSS-44 or in the stand-alone WURSS-21. Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60). CONCLUSION: The WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. Construct validity is supported by the data presented here. While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: One of the main strategies to control the spread of infectious animal diseases is the implementation of movement restrictions. This paper shows a loss in efficiency of the movement restriction policy (MRP) when behavioral responses of farmers are taken into account. Incorporating the strategic behavior of farmers in an epidemiologic model reveals that the MRP can trigger premature animal sales by farms at high risk of becoming infected that significantly reduce the efficacy of the policy. The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed. Financial aid to farmers can be justified by public health concerns, not only for equity.

      "Error parsing: The ability of bats to act as reservoir for viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans suggests unique properties and functional characteristics of their immune system. However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Here, we report a panel of cross-reactive antibodies against MHC-II, NK1.1, CD3, CD21, CD27, and immunoglobulin (Ig), that allows flow cytometry analysis of B, T and NK cell populations in two different fruit-eating bat species namely, Pteropus alecto and E. spelaea. Results confirmed predominance of T cells in the spleen and blood of bats, as previously reported by us. However, the percentages of B cells in bone marrow and NK cells in spleen varied greatly between wild caught P. alecto bats and E. spelaea colony bats, which may reflect inherent differences of their immune system or different immune status. Other features of bat B cells were investigated. A significant increase in sIg(+) B cell population was observed in the spleen and blood from LPS-injected bats but not from poly I:C-injected bats, supporting T-independent polyclonal B cell activation by LPS. Furthermore, using an in vitro calcium release assay, P. alecto B cells exhibited significant calcium release upon cross-linking of their B cell receptor. Together, this work contributes to improve our knowledge of bat adaptive immunity in particular B cells.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Abstract The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) exercises fundamental control over sodium and water handling in the kidney. Accordingly, dysregulation of the RAS leads to blood pressure elevation with ensuing renal and cardiovascular damage. Recent studies have revealed that the RAS hormonal cascade is more complex than initially posited with multiple enzymes, effector molecules, and receptors that coordinately regulate the effects of the RAS on the kidney and vasculature. Moreover, recently identified tissue-specific RAS components have pleomorphic effects independent of the circulating RAS that influence critical homeostatic mechanisms including the immune response and fetal development. Further characterization of the diverse interactions between the RAS and other signaling pathways within specific tissues should lead to novel treatments for renal and cardiovascular disease.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Effective vaccination is based on three critical aspects of the B-cell response towards infectious agents: (i) that B-cells can generate specific antibodies towards a vast molecular diversity of antigens; proteins, sugars, DNA and lipids. There seems to be no limit to the ability to raise antibodies to everything. (ii) once stimulated, B-cells can perfect their antibodies through affinity maturation to complement every nook and cranny of the epitope and (iii) that the pathogen remains genetically stable and does not change to any great extent. Thus, antibodies produced against the vaccine and subsequent boosts recognize the viral virulent field isolates in future encounters and effectively knock them out. However, some vaccine targets, such as flu virus and HIV, are extremely genetically dynamic. The rapid genetic drift of these viruses renders them moving targets which assist in their ability to evade immune surveillance. Here we postulate that in the case of hyper-variable pathogens the B-cell response actually might be “too good”. We propose that restricting B-cell activities may prove effective in counteracting the genetic diversity of variant viruses such as flu and HIV. We suggest two levels of “B-cell restriction”: (i) to focus the B-cell response exclusively towards neutralizing epitopes by creating epitope-based immunogens; (ii) to restrict affinity maturation of B-cells to prevent the production of overly optimized exquisitely specific antibodies. Together, these “B-cell restrictions” provide a new modality for vaccine design.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: The causative agent of a recent outbreak of an atypical pneumonia, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has been identified as a coronavirus (CoV) not belonging to any of the previously identified groups. Fusion of coronaviruses with the host cell is mediated by the envelope spike protein. Two regions within the spike protein of SARS-CoV have been identified, showing a high degree of sequence conservation with the other CoV, which are characterized by the presence of heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2). By using synthetic and recombinant peptides corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions, we were able to characterize the fusion-active complex formed by this novel CoV by CD, native PAGE, proteolysis protection analysis, and size-exclusion chromatography. HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV associate into an antiparallel six-helix bundle, with structural features typical of the other known class I fusion proteins. We have also mapped the specific boundaries of the region, within the longer HR1 domain, making contact with the shorter HR2 domain. Notably, the inner HR1 coiled coil is a stable α-helical domain even in the absence of interaction with the HR2 region. Inhibitors binding to HR regions of fusion proteins have been shown to be efficacious against many viruses, notably HIV. Our results may help in the design of anti-SARS therapeutics.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Plants are able to perform post-translational maturations of therapeutic proteins required for their functional biological activity and suitable in vivo pharmacokinetics. Plants can be a low-cost, large-scale production platform of recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins such as vaccines and antibodies. Plants, however, lack mechanisms of processing authentic human N-glycosylation, which imposes a major limitation in their use as an expression system for therapeutic glycoproducts. Efforts have been made to circumvent plant-specific N-glycosylation, as well as to supplement the plant's endogenous system with human glycosyltransferases for non-immunogenic and humanized N-glycan production. Herein we review studies on the potential of plants to serve as production systems for therapeutic and prophylactic biopharmaceuticals. We have especially focused on recombinant vaccines and antibodies and new expression strategies to overcome the existing problems associated with their production in plants.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Federal, provincial and municipal leaders in Canada have adopted a culture of preparedness with the development and update of emergency plans in anticipation of different types of disasters. As evident during the 2003 global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it is important to provide support for health care workers (HCWs) who are vulnerable during infectious outbreak scenarios. Here we focus on the identification and evaluation of existing support mechanisms incorporated within emergency plans across various jurisdictional levels. METHODS: Qualitative content analysis of 12 emergency plans from national, provincial and municipal levels were conducted using NVIVOTM software. The plans were scanned and coded according to 1) informational, 2) instrumental, and 3) emotional support mechanisms for HCWs and other first responders. RESULTS: Emergency plans were comprised of a predominance of informational and instrumental supports, yet few emotional or social support mechanisms. All the plans lacked gender-based analysis of how infectious disease outbreaks impact male and female HCWs differently. Acknowledgement of the need for emotional supports was evident at higher jurisdictional levels, but recommended for implementation locally. CONCLUSIONS: While support mechanisms for HCWs are included in this sample of emergency plans, content analysis revealed few emotional or social supports planned for critical personnel; particularly for those who will be required to work in extremely stressful conditions under significant personal risk. The implications of transferring responsibilities for support to local and institutional jurisdictions are discussed.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause annual seasonal human respiratory disease epidemics. In addition, IAV have been implicated in occasional pandemics with inordinate health and economic consequences. Studying IAV, in vitro or in vivo, requires the use of laborious secondary methodologies to identify virus-infected cells. To circumvent this requirement, replication-competent IAV expressing an easily traceable reporter protein can be used. Here we discuss the development and applications of recombinant replication-competent IAV harboring diverse fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter genes in different locations of the viral genome. These viruses have been employed for in vitro and in vivo studies, such as the screening of neutralizing antibodies or antiviral compounds, the identification of host factors involved in viral replication, cell tropism, the development of vaccines, or the assessment of viral infection dynamics. In summary, reporter-expressing, replicating-competent IAV represent a powerful tool for the study of IAV both in vitro and in vivo.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: In origine, l’extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) era una tecnica di assistenza respiratoria che utilizzava uno scambiatore gassoso a membrana. Per estensione, l’ECMO è diventata una tecnica respiratoria e cardiopolmonare utilizzata in caso di deficit respiratorio e/o cardiaco nell’attesa della restaurazione della funzione deficitaria o di un eventuale trapianto. Il supporto emodinamico può essere parziale o totale. Gli accessi vascolari possono essere periferici o centrali. Questo tipo di assistenza utilizza il concetto di circolazione extracorporea (CEC) sanguigna che in epoca moderna si è estesa con l’utilizzo di polmoni artificiali a membrana. Il circuito di base è semplice e comprende una pompa, un ossigenatore (che permette al sangue di caricarsi di O2 e di eliminare CO2) e delle vie d’accesso (una di drenaggio e una di reinfusione). La sua attuazione è facile, veloce e può essere avviata al letto del malato. Il miglioramento delle attrezzature, una migliore conoscenza delle tecniche e delle indicazioni, e le politiche di salute pubblica hanno reso popolare questa tecnica. Alcuni centri di chirurgia toracica la utilizzano di routine come assistenza alla realizzazione di un intervento terapeutico (soprattutto trapianto) assieme a team di rianimazione per il trattamento della sindrome da distress respiratorio acuto. Nel quadro della malattia polmonare dell’adulto, l’idea principale è quella di sviluppare il concetto di strategia minimalista con l’uso di una CEC adiuvante parziale – più che sostitutiva totale – che permetterebbe il recupero metabolico ad integrum del paziente. Nei prossimi anni, i progressi della tecnologia e dell’ingegneria così come le conoscenze approfondite permetteranno il miglioramento della prognosi dei pazienti colpiti da deficit respiratorio sotto assistenza meccanica.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Summary Background In 2015, a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred following a single patient exposure in an emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary-care hospital in Seoul, South Korea. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of MERS-CoV outbreak in our hospital. Methods We identified all patients and health-care workers who had been in the emergency room with the index case between May 27 and May 29, 2015. Patients were categorised on the basis of their exposure in the emergency room: in the same zone as the index case (group A), in different zones except for overlap at the registration area or the radiology suite (group B), and in different zones (group C). We documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, confirmed by real-time PCR testing of sputum samples. We analysed attack rates, incubation periods of the virus, and risk factors for transmission. Findings 675 patients and 218 health-care workers were identified as contacts. MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 82 individuals (33 patients, eight health-care workers, and 41 visitors). The attack rate was highest in group A (20% [23/117] vs 5% [3/58] in group B vs 1% [4/500] in group C; p<0·0001), and was 2% (5/218) in health-care workers. After excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 2–17, IQR 5–10). The median incubation period was significantly shorter in group A than in group C (5 days [IQR 4–8] vs 11 days [6–12]; p<0·0001). There were no confirmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on May 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. The main risk factor for transmission of MERS-CoV was the location of exposure. Interpretation Our results showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Mucosal immune responses within the middle ear and eustachian tube generally provide an effective and efficient response to the presence of microbial pathogens, with approximately 80% of clinically recognizable middle ear infections resolved within 7days. Particularly for young children aged less than 3years of age, the proximity and direct connection of the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to the nasopharynx provide increased risk of commensal bacteria and upper respiratory tract viruses infecting the middle ear. Mucosal immunological defense in the middle ear and eustachian tube utilizes a number of mechanisms, including physicochemical barriers of mucus and the mucosal epithelial cells and innate immune responses such as inflammation, cellular infiltration, effusion, and antimicrobial protein secretions, in addition to adaptive host immune responses. Recent advances in otopathogen recognition via microbial pattern recognition receptors and elucidation of complex signaling cascades have improved understanding of the coordination and regulation of the middle ear mucosal response.

This study presents the molecular characterization of chicken astrovirus (CAstV), PL/G059/2014, which is involved in the induction of “white chicks” condition. The 7382-nucleotide-long genome sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq System. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it has the characteristics that are typical of avian astroviruses. However, overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 43.6 % to 73.7 % between PL/G059/2014 and other available genome sequences of aAstV strains. The amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b of the studied strain were very similar (86.5-93.8 % identity) to those of CAstVs 4175 and GA2011, but they were only 32.7-35.2 % identical in the case of ORF2, which is used officially for astrovirus species demarcation. These features could suggest that the PL/G059/2014 strain should be assigned to a new species in the genus Avastrovirus. Moreover, the different phylogenetic topology of PL/G059/2014 and its nucleotide sequence similarity in different genomic regions could suggest that a recombination event occurred during its evolution and that it has ancestors in common with duck astroviruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Thirty five patients were transferred to Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) after the Bali bombings. The patients had severe burn injuries and were considered to be at high-risk of both the carriage and acquisition of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). Whilst seeking to protect the Bali patients with a comprehensive infection control response, we also sought to protect other high-risk patients from nosocomial acquisition of MROs. MROs were detected from 25 (82%) of the 29 Bali patients admitted to RPH. Bali patients were colonised, or infected, with one or more of the following MROs: multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) (19 patients), extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria (15 patients), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (nine patients), multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) (six patients), multi-resistant Chryseobacterium sp. (four patients), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (three patients). Five Bali patients developed a total of eight bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in two patients. Since the Bali bombings horizontal transmission of Bali MROs has occurred in 41 non-Bali patients in RPH. MRPA has had the greatest clinical impact. Eight non-Bali patients developed a total of 11 bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in four patients. However, apart from MRPA, we have now controlled transmission of the other MROs in RPH. The emergency response to the Bali disaster required strong leadership, good communication and multi-disciplinary teamwork. The infection control strategy contributed to good outcomes for most Bali bombing patients. However, many patients within the Bali cohort were heavily colonised with MROs, and some developed invasive infection. Subsequent nosocomial transmission of these MROs to non-Bali patients has been a legacy of the Bali tragedy.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: This Perspectives in Veterinary Medicine article seeks to define, describe putative causes, and discuss key diagnostic tests for primary and secondary bronchiolar disorders to propose a classification scheme in cats with support from a literature review and case examples. The small airways (bronchioles with inner diameters <2 mm), located at the transitional zone between larger conducting airways and the pulmonary acinus, have been overlooked as major contributors to clinical syndromes of respiratory disease in cats. Because the trigger for many bronchiolar disorders is environmental and humans live in a shared environment with similar susceptibility, understanding these diseases in pet cats has relevance to One Health. Thoracic radiography, the major imaging modality used in the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory disease in cats, has low utility in detection of bronchiolar disease. Computed tomography (CT) with paired inspiratory and expiratory scans can detect pathology centered on small airways. In humans, treatment of bronchiolar disorders is not well established because of heterogeneous presentations and often late definitive diagnosis. A review of the human and veterinary medical literature will serve as the basis for a proposed classification scheme in cats. A case series of cats with CT or histopathologic evidence of bronchiolar lesions or both, either as a primary disorder or secondary to extension from large airway disease or interstitial lung disease, will be presented. Future multi‐institutional and multidisciplinary discussions among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will help refine and develop this classification scheme to promote early and specific recognition and optimize treatment.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), nearly a decade ago with worldwide distribution, was believed to be of zoonotic origin from bats with dromedary camels as intermediate hosts. There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus. The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species. The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes. Livestock were left unconfined on eight farms (25.8%) that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes. No viral RNA or antibodies against the two coronaviruses were detected in any of the livestock species tested.

To understand the functional significance of this protein, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for this protein were generated and used for passive immunization of mice. None of these MAbs showed any virus-neutralizing activity in vitro; however, mice passively immunized with the purified MAbs were protected from lethal infection by the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Passive immunization altered the pathogenicity such that the virus caused subacute and chronic demyelination instead of acute lethal encephalitis. Virus titers in the brains of the immunized mice were significantly lower than those for the nonimmunized control mice, suggesting that the virus replication or spread was inhibited. In addition, histopathological analysis indicated that the spread of virus in the brain and spinal cord was significantly inhibited in the immunized mice. Furthermore, the mononuclear cell infiltration in the immunized mice appeared earlier than in the nonimmunized mice, suggesting that the exogenous antibody might have activated host immune responses, and thus facilitated clearance of the virus or virus-infected cells. The same protective effects were observed for both JHM(2) and JHM(3) viruses, which expressed different amounts of the HE protein. In contrast, mice infected with At11f, a variant of JHM which does not express the HE protein, were not protected by these MAbs, suggesting that protection was mediated by the specific interaction between the MAb and the HE protein. Thus, the mechanism of protection by the exogenous HE-specific MAbs may represent the early activation of innate immune mechanisms in response to the interaction between the MAbs and the HE protein.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The biological function of bovine colostral immunoglobulins is to provide the newborn calf with adequate passive immune protection against microbial infections. Immunoglobulin preparations designed for farm animals are commercially available, and some colostrum-based products are marketed also for humans as dietary supplements. The concentration of specific antibodies against a certain pathogenic microorganism can be raised in colostrum and milk by immunizing cows with this pathogen or its antigen. Advances in bioseparation and chromatographic techniques have made it possible to fractionate and enrich these antibodies and formulate so-called hyperimmune colostral or milk preparations. Their efficacy in prevention and treatment of various microbial infections has been evaluated in numerous studies. Immune milk preparations have proven effective in prophylaxis against infections caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems more limited. A few commercial immune milk products are already on market and more applications can be expected in the coming years. This article reviews the recent progress made in isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins and the application of colostral and immune milk preparations in fighting various microbial infectious diseases in humans.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Groups 1–4 received 100, 200, 400 and 800mg/L of sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) with IB vaccine H120 respectively. Group 5 received PBS and H120 and group 6 IL-2 and H120. The chickens were inoculated at 7 and 14days of age. On 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 post first vaccination, the dynamic changes of peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine assays and serum antibody titers were assayed respectively by MTT method, ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI). The results showed that sodium new houttuyfonate significantly raised IB antibody titer in the chickens and also markedly promoted lymphocyte proliferation. The serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 in groups 1–4 were higher than those in groups 5 and 6. Hence, the immunologic enhancement of SNH was slightly superior to that of IL-2 adjuvant. Following challenge with IBV, chickens inoculated with SNH showed fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower death rate and less kidney pathology, as compared to those of the control groups. It indicated that SNH could enhance immune responses and increase protection against virulent IBV challenge in chickens.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In this review, genes associated with the tumor phenotype have been arranged on the human gene map and indicate the extent to which the tumor phenotype involves the human genome.

Altered metabolic demands of the tumor cell are reflected in altered gene expressions of a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, and these changed enzyme patterns are described. The study of oncogenes increasingly suggests that they may be significant in certain cancers, and the assignment of these genes has been tabulated.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), which cause gastrointestinal and respiratory illness, have been isolated from a wide variety of mammalian species including bats, minks, pigs and humans. Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Microglia express muscarinic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that sense cholinergic activity and are activated by acetylcholine to potentially regulate microglial functions. Knowledge about how distinct types of muscarinic GPCR signaling regulate microglia function in vitro and in vivo is still poor, partly due to the fact that some of these receptors are also present in astrocytes and neurons. We generated mice expressing the hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) selectively in microglia to investigate the role of muscarinic M3Gq-linked signaling. We show that activation of hM3Dq using clozapine N-oxide (CNO) elevated intracellular calcium levels and increased phagocytosis of FluoSpheres in vitro. Acute treatment with CNO in vivo did not affect male mouse behavior, however chronic CNO treatment decreased sickness behavior triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Interestingly, whereas acute treatment with CNO increased synthesis of cytokine mRNA, chronic treatment attenuated LPS-induced cytokine mRNA changes in the brain, likely explaining the improvement in sickness behavior by chronic hM3Dq activation. No effect of CNO was observed in DREADD-negative mice. These results suggest that chronic activation of M3 muscarinic receptors (the hM3Dq progenitor) in microglia, and potentially other Gq-coupled GPCRs, preconditions microglia to decrease their response to further immunological challenges. Our results indicate that hM3Dq can be a useful tool to modulate neuroinflammation and study microglial immunological memory in vivo, which may be applicable for manipulations of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

      "Error parsing: INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of disability and death. The most common cause of COPD is smoking. There is evidence suggesting that genetic factors influence COPD susceptibility and variants in several candidate genes have been significantly associated with COPD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association of the TNF-α –308, SPB+1580, IL-13 –1055 gene polymorphisms and latent adenovirus C infection with COPD in an Egyptian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included 115 subjects (75 smokers with COPD, 25 resistant smokers and 15 non-smokers) who were subjected to spirometric measurements, identification of adenovirus C and genotyping of TNF-α –308G/A, SP-B+1580 C/T and IL-13 –1055 C/T polymorphisms by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The adenovirus C gene was identified in all subjects. The distribution of TNF-α genotypes showed no significant differences between different groups. However, homozygous A genotype was associated with a significant decrease in FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC and FEF25/75% of predicted in COPD (p < 0.05). As regards SP-B genotypes, resistant smokers had a significantly higher homozygous T genotype frequency compared to COPD and non smokers (p = 0.005). Interleukin 13 genotypes showed no significant difference between different groups. There was a significant decrease in FEF25/75% of predicted in T allele carriers in COPD patients (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COPD is a disease caused by the interaction of combined genes and environmental influences, in the presence of smoking and latent adenovirus C infection, TNF-α –308A, SPB +1580 T and IL-13 –1055 T polymorphisms predispose to the development of COPD.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract PURPOSE: Most patients with acute bronchitis who seek medical care are treated with antibiotics, although the effectiveness of this intervention is uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the duration of cough and sputum production by approximately one-half day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, −0.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, −0.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, −0.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) play essential roles in viral genome replication and transcription. We previously reported several structural states of the poliovirus RdRP nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) that revealed a unique palm domain-based active site closure mechanism and proposed a six-state NAC model including a hypothetical state representing translocation intermediates. Using the RdRP from another human enterovirus, enterovirus 71, here we report seven RdRP elongation complex structures derived from a crystal lattice that allows three NAC events. These structures suggested a key order of events in initial NTP binding and NTP-induced active site closure and revealed a bona fide translocation intermediate featuring asymmetric movement of the template–product duplex. Our work provides essential missing links in understanding NTP recognition and translocation mechanisms in viral RdRPs and emphasizes the uniqueness of the viral RdRPs compared with other processive polymerases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused economic losses in the Americas, Asia and Europe in recent years. Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement (κ=0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% (62.1–74.4%) and 97.5% (95.2–99.0%) for ELISA 1, 73.7% (71.5–79.6%) and 98.4% (96.6–99.5%) for ELISA 2, 86.2% (81.1–90.6%) and 91.6% (87.7–94.8%) for ELISA 3, 78.3% (72.8–83.5%) and 99.7% (98.2–100%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5% (90.3–96.0%) and 91.2% (83.8–97.9%) for ELISA 5. Differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the PEDV antigen used.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a stress-induced cyto-protective mechanism elicited towards an influx of large amount of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the present study, we evaluated if AAV manipulates the UPR pathways during its infection. We first examined the role of the three major UPR axes, namely, endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in AAV infected cells. Total RNA from mock or AAV infected HeLa cells were used to determine the levels of 8 different ER-stress responsive transcripts from these pathways. We observed a significant up-regulation of IRE1α (up to 11 fold) and PERK (up to 8 fold) genes 12–48 hours after infection with self-complementary (sc)AAV2 but less prominent with single-stranded (ss)AAV2 vectors. Further studies demonstrated that scAAV1 and scAAV6 also induce cellular UPR in vitro, with AAV1 vectors activating the PERK pathway (3 fold) while AAV6 vectors induced a significant increase on all the three major UPR pathways [6–16 fold]. These data suggest that the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid. We then examined if transient inhibition of UPR pathways by RNA interference has an effect on AAV transduction. siRNA mediated silencing of PERK and IRE1α had a modest effect on AAV2 and AAV6 mediated gene expression (∼1.5–2 fold) in vitro. Furthermore, hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors in vivo, strongly elevated IRE1α and PERK pathways (2 and 3.5 fold, respectively). However, when animals were pre-treated with a pharmacological UPR inhibitor (metformin) during scAAV2 gene transfer, the UPR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response was attenuated concomitant to a modest 2.8 fold increase in transgene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that AAV vectors activate the cellular UPR pathways and their selective inhibition may be beneficial during AAV mediated gene transfer.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Diagnostic systems for Lassa fever (LF), a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV), such as enzyme immunoassays for the detection of LASV antibodies and LASV antigens, were developed using the recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP) of LASV (LASV-rNP). The LASV-rNP was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. LASV-rNP was used as an antigen in the detection of LASV-antibodies and as an immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The LASV-rNP was also expressed in HeLa cells by transfection with the expression vector encoding cDNA of the LASV-NP gene. An immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using LASV-rNP and an indirect immunofluorescence assay using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells were confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LASV-antibodies. A novel monoclonal antibody to LASV-rNP, monoclonal antibody 4A5, was established. A sandwich antigen capture (Ag-capture) ELISA using the monoclonal antibody and an anti-LASV-rNP rabbit serum as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, was then developed. Authentic LASV nucleoprotein in serum samples collected from hamsters experimentally infected with LASV was detected by the Ag-capture ELISA. The Ag-capture ELISA specifically detected LASV-rNP but not the rNPs of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Junin virus. The sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA in detecting LASV antigens was comparable to that of reverse transcription-PCR in detecting LASV RNA. These LASV rNP-based diagnostics were confirmed to be useful in the diagnosis of LF even in institutes without a high containment laboratory, since the antigens can be prepared without manipulation of the infectious viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China and spread to all over the world in 2003. Without comprehensive protection, during a severe hospital outbreak in the Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH), there were 78 patients diagnosed with SARS and two deaths. During treatment, most patients received large doses of steroid shock therapy, which may result in complications of femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to follow up the condition of lung and bone in those patients. Methods We did an observational cohort study of patients with SARS from 2003 to 2018. We carried out pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI tests, pulmonary function tests, and hip joint functional assessment to evaluate the recovery condition of lung damage and femoral head necrosis according to patients' willingness. We used linear regression, and mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to measure the change of lung interstitial and femoral head necrosis volume. This study was authorised by the Ethics Committee of Peking University People's Hospital (2018PHB010-01). All recruited SARS patients signed informed consent for the study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03443102. Findings There were 80 medical staff patients with SARS altogether in Peking University People's Hospital. Two patients died of SARS in 2003 and 78 patients were enrolled in this study from August, 2003, to March, 2018. 71 patients completed the 15 years' follow-up and seven patients were missing. Pulmonary injury scope on lung CT improved from 2003 (9·40%, SD 7·83) to 2004 (3·20%, 4·78; p≤0·001), and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (4·60%, 6·37). Pulmonary function items in patients with SARS did not differ between 2006 and 2018. The recovery extent of pulmonary function items between 2006 and 2018 in patients with lung interstitial change (n=13), was less than that without lung interstitial changes (n=23), especially in one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC, t=2·21, p=0·04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25–75%, t=2·76, p=0·01). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38·83%, SD 21·01) to 2005 (30·38%, 20·23; p=0·0002), then decreased slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28·99%, 20·59) and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (25·52%, 15·51)%. Interpretation Damaged lung interstitial and functional decline induced by SARS mainly recovered in the next 1–2 years after rehabilitation. The natural process of femoral head necrosis caused by large doses of steroid shock therapy in SARS patients was not progressive, while partially reversible.

      "Error parsing: Abstract The recent avian influenza outbreaks underscore the importance of improving our preparedness for an impending influenza pandemic. Various strategies, including pharmaceutical interventions (such as vaccines and antivirals) and nonpharmaceutical interventions (such as quarantine, isolation, and social distancing) may be implemented to mitigate the impact of a pandemic. It is necessary to understand the potential benefits and limitations of each strategy to determine the most appropriate strategies to be implemented. In this article, each strategy is reviewed to define its potential benefits and limitations during a pandemic. Vaccines are probably the most effective measure to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, vaccines are not likely to be available at an early stage of a pandemic. The supply of vaccines is most likely to be insufficient due to limited worldwide production capacity. Antivirals, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors, are expected to be effective against a pandemic influenza strain and are the only available pharmaceutical intervention until enough vaccines are produced. Shortage of supply and high cost is still a major limiting factor in amassing large stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors. The possible emergence of resistant strains should also be considered. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective in preventing the spread of the virus under certain conditions. The effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends on how influenza viruses are transmitted. There are still significant gaps in the scientific evidence of the way in which influenza viruses are transmitted. Further studies should be conducted to define the basic transmission patterns of influenza viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: There are currently no vaccines or antivirals available for dengue virus infection, which can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and death. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by cross-linking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 during the first Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. MERS-CoV causes an acute lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~35.5%. Currently, there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against MERS in the world. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein plays the most important role in the viral life cycle (virus internalization). The S protein is an immunodominant antigen and the main target for neutralizing antibodies. In the present study, the immunogenicities of five different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein were compared: the full-length S glycoprotein, the full-length S glycoprotein with the transmembrane domain of the G glycoprotein of VSV (S-G), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein, the membrane-fused RBD (the RBD fused with the transmembrane domain of the VSV G glycoprotein (RBD-G)), and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc). Recombinant vectors based on human adenoviruses type 5 (rAd5) were used as delivery vehicles. Vaccination with all of the developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response in mice. The most robust humoral immune response was induced after the animal had been vaccinated with the membrane-fused RBD (rAd5-RBD-G). Only immunization with membrane forms of the glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) elicited neutralizing antibodies among all vaccinated animals. The most significant cellular immune response was induced after vaccination of the animals with the full-length S (rAd5-S). These investigations suggest that the full-length S and the membrane form of the RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of S glycoprotein.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Developing a novel drug is a complex, risky, expensive and time-consuming venture. It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

A strong correlation between disease susceptibility and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) has been previously demonstrated, but no strong correlation between disease susceptibility and total anti-TMEV ELISA titres was shown. Since both DTH and IgG2a antibody production are regulated by CD4+ Th1 cells, we investigated three strains of mice to determine whether antivirus IgG2a antibody levels, like DTH in previous studies, correlated with disease susceptibility. Susceptible SJL/J, intermediately susceptible C3H/HeJ, and resistant C57BL/6 mice were infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with the BeAn strain of TMEV and monitored for clinical signs of demyelination and for levels of TMEV-specific antibody of different IgG subclasses using a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA). Resistant C57BL/6 mice were found to have significantly lower concentrations of total anti-TMEV antibody than susceptible SJL/J mice and intermediately susceptible C3H/HeJ mice show variable antibody responses. A predominance of anti-TMEV IgG2a (Th1 regulated) antibody was seen in susceptible and intermediately susceptible mice, whereas resistant mice displayed a predominant anti-TMEV IgG1 (Th2 regulated) response accompanied by a marked deficiency of IgG2a. In contrast, immunization of C57BL/6 mice with UV-inactivated TMEV in adjuvant revealed that this strain was not defective either in its ability to generate high levels of anti-TMEV antibody or in its ability to produce IgG2a antibody. These results suggest that the antivirus IgG subclass profile is dependent upon the immunization route, virus viability and/or the use of adjuvant and that the levels of antivirus subclasses may be predictive of disease susceptibility.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Climate change has been identified as potentially the biggest health threat of the 21st century. Canada in general has a well developed public health system and low burden of health which will moderate vulnerability. However, there is significant heterogeneity in health outcomes, and health inequality is particularly pronounced among Aboriginal Canadians. Intervention is needed to prevent, prepare for, and manage climate change effects on Aboriginal health but is constrained by a limited understanding of vulnerability and its determinants. Despite limited research on climate change and Aboriginal health, however, there is a well established literature on Aboriginal health outcomes, determinants, and trends in Canada; characteristics that will determine vulnerability to climate change. In this paper we systematically review this literature, using a vulnerability framework to identify the broad level factors constraining adaptive capacity and increasing sensitivity to climate change. Determinants identified include: poverty, technological capacity constraints, socio-political values and inequality, institutional capacity challenges, and information deficit. The magnitude and nature of these determinants will be distributed unevenly within and between Aboriginal populations necessitating place-based and regional level studies to examine how these broad factors will affect vulnerability at lower levels. The study also supports the need for collaboration across all sectors and levels of government, open and meaningful dialogue between policy makers, scientists, health professionals, and Aboriginal communities, and capacity building at a local level, to plan for climate change. Ultimately, however, efforts to reduce the vulnerability of Aboriginal Canadians to climate change and intervene to prevent, reduce, and manage climate-sensitive health outcomes, will fail unless the broader determinants of socio-economic and health inequality are addressed.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

However, current ligation-based RNA capture methods require RNA substrates with terminal 3′-hydroxyl groups, limiting their utility for identifying RNAs with modified termini like 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates. Cyclic phosphate-terminated RNAs are generated by endonucleolytic cleavages and self-cleaving ribozymes and are found as stable modifications on cellular RNAs such as the U6 spliceosomal RNA. We developed a method that uses the Arabidopsis thaliana tRNA ligase to add an adaptor oligonucleotide to RNAs that terminate in 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates. The adaptor allows specific priming by reverse transcriptase, which is followed by additional steps for PCR amplification and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Applying the method to total human RNA, we found 2836 sequencing reads corresponding to the 3′ terminus of U6 snRNA, validating the method. In addition to a large background of reads that map throughout abundantly transcribed RNAs, we also found 42,324 reads of specific fragments from several tRNA isoacceptor families, suggesting that this method may identify processing events previously undetected by other RNA cloning techniques.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome containing a single open reading frame flanked by the 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions (NCRs). The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 5′-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA - 5NCR(+), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA - 3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that co-localized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plus-sense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, PTB-mediated, innate host response that could effectively suppress JEV replication in mammalian cells.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naive population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated. By using animal models in this endeavor, the response to viruses can be studied in a more natural context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products. This is especially true in the advent of the Food and Drug Administration's animal rule. Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all the aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design. Important facets to be considered before an animal study are the route of challenge, species of animals, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint. This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which first broken out in Jeddah in 2012, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a high mortality rate. To better understand the molecular characteristics of isolated MERS-CoV genomes, we first analysed the codon usage pattern of the zoonotic MERS-CoV strains comprehensively to gain an insight into the mechanism of cross-species transmission. We found that MERS human/camel isolates showed a low codon usage bias. Both mutation and nature selection pressure have contributed to this low codon usage bias, with the former being the main determining factor. We also observed that gene function, evolution time and the different host species of the virus all contributed to the bias of MERS-CoV, to some extent. Additionally, the codon usage pattern of MERS-CoV isolates is different from other related Nidovirales viruses isolated from bats and hedgehogs. In the future, more epidemiological surveys are required to examine the factors that resulted in the emergence and outbreak of this virus.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The ever-increasing speed and scope of human mobility by international air travel has led to a global transport network for infectious diseases with the potential to introduce pathogens into non-endemic areas, and to facilitate rapid spread of novel or mutated zoonotic agents. Robust national emergency preparedness is vital to mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases agents domestically and to prevent onward spread to other countries. Given the complex range of stakeholders who respond to an infectious disease threat being transmitted through air travel, it is important that protocols be tested and practised extensively in advance of a real emergency. Simulation exercises include the identification of possible scenarios based on the probability of hazards and the vulnerability of populations as a basis for planning, and provide a useful measure of preparedness efforts and capabilities. In October 2016, a live simulation exercise was conducted at a major airport in Ireland incorporating a public health threat for the first time, with the notification of a possible case of MERS-CoV aboard an aircraft plus an undercarriage fire. Strengths of the response to the communicable disease threat included appropriate public health risk assessment, case management, passenger information gathering, notification to relevant parties, and communication to passengers and multiple agencies. Lessons learned include: o Exercise planning should not be overly ambitious. In testing too many facets of emergency response, the public health response could be deprioritised. o The practical implementation of communication protocols in a real-time exercise of this scope proved challenging. These protocols should continue to be checked and tested by desk-top exercises to ensure that all staff concerned are familiar with them, especially in the context of staff turn-over. o The roles and responsibilities of the various agencies must be clear to avoid role confusion. o Equipment and infrastructure capacities must be considered and in place in advance of an actual incident or test, for example whether or not cell phone signals require boosting during a major event. Importantly, exercises bring together individuals representing organisations with different roles and perspectives allowing identification of capabilities and limitations, and problem solving about how to address the gaps and overlaps in a low-threat collaborative setting.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

N-linked glycosylation is involved in stability and function of these proteins and occurs at Asn residues. In several organs, profiles of N-glycans have been determined by comprehensive analyses. Nevertheless, the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear, a tiny organ mediating hearing, has yet to be examined. Here, we focused on the stria vascularis, an epithelial-like tissue in the cochlea, and characterised N-glycans by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. This hypervascular tissue not only expresses several ion transporters and channels to control the electrochemical balance in the cochlea but also harbours different transporters and receptors that maintain structure and activity of the organ. Seventy-nine N-linked glycans were identified in the rat stria vascularis. Among these, in 55 glycans, the complete structures were determined; in the other 24 species, partial glycosidic linkage patterns and full profiles of the monosaccharide composition were identified. In the process of characterisation, several sialylated glycans were subjected sequentially to two different alkylamidation reactions; this derivatisation helped to distinguish α2,3-linkage and α2,6-linkage sialyl isomers with mass spectrometry.

      "Error parsing: Abstract The matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) performs multiple functions during viral genome replication and virion production and is involved in modulating multiple host signaling pathways that favor virus replication. To perform numerous functions within infected cells, the M protein needs to recruit cellular partners. To better understand the role of M during VSV replication, we looked for interacting partners by using the two-hybrid system. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit i (eIF3i) was identified to be an M-binding partner, and this interaction was validated by GST pull-down and laser confocal assays. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutants of M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M–eIF3i interaction. Furthermore, the knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased viral replication and transcription in the early stages but led to increase in later stages. VSV transcription was increased at 4h post-infection but was not changed at 8 and 12h post-infection after the over-expression of eIF3i. Finally, we also demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the activity of Akt1 and that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of the ISGs regulated by phospho-Akt1. These results indicated that eIF3i may affect VSV growth by regulating the host antiviral response in HeLa cells.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Enteroviruses comprise a large group of mammalian pathogens that includes poliovirus. Pathology in humans ranges from sub-clinical to acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis and meningitis. Until now, all the enteroviral proteins were thought to derive from proteolytic processing of a polyprotein encoded in a single open reading frame (ORF). We report that many enterovirus genomes also harbor an upstream ORF (uORF) that is subject to strong purifying selection. Using echovirus 7 and poliovirus 1, we confirmed expression of uORF protein (UP) in infected cells. Using ribosome profiling (a technique for global footprinting of translating ribosomes), we also demonstrated translation of the uORF in representative members of the predominant human enterovirus species, namely Enterovirus A, B, and C. In differentiated human intestinal organoids, UP-knockout echoviruses are attenuated compared to wild-type virus at late stages of infection where membrane-associated UP facilitates virus release. Thus we have identified a previously unknown enterovirus protein that facilitates virus growth in gut epithelial cells – the site of initial viral invasion into susceptible hosts. These findings overturn the 50-year-old dogma that enteroviruses use a single-polyprotein gene expression strategy, and have important implications for understanding enterovirus pathogenesis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Involved in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs. It is time-consuming and expensive to determine whether a drug and a GPCR are to interact with each other in a cellular network purely by means of experimental techniques. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the 3D (dimensional) structure of protein, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because the 3D structures for most GPCRs are still unknown. To overcome the situation, a sequence-based classifier, called “iGPCR-drug”, was developed to predict the interactions between GPCRs and drugs in cellular networking. In the predictor, the drug compound is formulated by a 2D (dimensional) fingerprint via a 256D vector, GPCR by the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) generated with the grey model theory, and the prediction engine is operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iGPCR-drug was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated math equations presented in this paper just for its integrity. The overall success rate achieved by iGPCR-drug via the jackknife test was 85.5%, which is remarkably higher than the rate by the existing peer method developed in 2010 although no web server was ever established for it. It is anticipated that iGPCR-Drug may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the approach presented here can also be extended to study other drug – target interaction networks.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Coronaviruses infect many species of animal including humans, causing acute and chronic diseases of many organ systems. Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the mouse, provides animal models for the study of central nervous system disease, including encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and for hepatitis. While there are many studies of the adaptive immune response to MHV, there has until recently been scant information on the type I interferon (IFN) response to MHV. The relationship between MHV and the IFN-α/β response is paradoxical. While the type I IFN response is a crucial aspect of host defense against MHV in its natural host, there is little if any induction of IFN following infection of mouse fibroblast cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, MHV is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-α/β in mouse fibroblast cell lines and in human 293T cells. MHV can, under some circumstances, compromise the antiviral effects of IFN signaling. The nucleocapsid protein as well as the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins of MHV has been reported to have IFN antagonist activity. However, in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, IFN is induced by MHV infection and an antiviral state is established. Other primary cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hepatocytes fail to produce IFN following infection and, in vivo, likely depend on IFN produced by pDCs and macrophages for protection from MHV. Thus MHV induction of IFN-α/β and the ability to induce an antiviral state in response to interferon is extremely cell type dependent. IFN induced protection from MHV pathogenesis likely requires the orchestrated activities of several cell types, however, the cell types involved in limiting MHV replication may be different in the liver and in the immune privileged CNS.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Study design All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract A single intracerebroventricular injection of 100 ng of β-endorphin altered the course of the central nervous system (CNS) infection of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), tsG31-KS5. When mice were administered β-endorphin and then 24 h later infected intracerebrally with tsG31-Ks5 VSV, 70% of the animals died within 8 days of infection. In comparison, less than 10% of the animals had died after 21 days when infected with tsG31-KS5 VSV alone. When mice were injected with β-endorphin and tsG31-KS5 VSV simultaneously, or with β-endorphin 21 days after infection, the more aggressive clinical disease was not observed. Superficially, the more lethal disease induced by β-endorphin appeared to be a result of a mild hypothermia caused by the neuropeptide. β-Endorphin, however, did not influence the disease in nude (nu/nu) mice even though their core temperatures were reduced to an extent similar to that of BALB/c (+/+) mice, implicating the involvement of T lymphocytes in the alteration of the course of infection in normal mice.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Colostrum-replacement products are an alternative to provide passive immunity to neonatal calves; however, their ability to provide adequate levels of antibodies recognizing respiratory viruses has not been described. The objective of this study was to compare the serum levels of IgG at 2 d of age and the duration of detection of antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) in calves fed maternal colostrum (MC) or a colostrum replacement (CR) at birth. Forty newborn male Holstein calves were assigned to the CR or the MC group. Group CR (n = 20) received 2 packets of colostrum replacement (100 g of IgG per 470-g packet), while group MC (n = 20) received 3.8 L of maternal colostrum. Blood samples for detection of IgG and virus antibodies were collected from each calf at birth, at 2 and 7 d, and monthly until the calves became seronegative. Calves in the MC group had greater IgG concentrations at 2 d of age. The apparent efficiency of absorption of IgG was greater in the MC group than in the CR group, although the difference was not significant. Calves in the CR group had greater concentrations of BVDV neutralizing antibodies during the first 4 mo of life. The levels of antibodies to BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 were similar in the 2 groups. The mean time to seronegativity was similar for each virus in the 2 groups; however, greater variation was observed in the antibody levels and in the duration of detection of immunity in the MC group than in the CR group. Thus, the CR product provided calves with more uniform levels and duration of antibodies to common bovine respiratory viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Dendritic cells (DCs), especially plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), produce large amounts of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) upon infection with DNA or RNA viruses, which has impacts on the physiopathology of the viral infections and on the quality of the adaptive immunity. However, little is known about the IFN-α/β production by DCs during infections by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. We present here novel information about the production of IFN-α/β induced by bluetongue virus (BTV), a vector-borne dsRNA Orbivirus of ruminants, in sheep primary DCs. We found that BTV induced IFN-α/β in skin lymph and in blood in vivo. Although BTV replicated in a substantial fraction of the conventional DCs (cDCs) and pDCs in vitro, only pDCs responded to BTV by producing a significant amount of IFN-α/β. BTV replication in pDCs was not mandatory for IFN-α/β production since it was still induced by UV-inactivated BTV (UV-BTV). Other inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-12p40, were also induced by UV-BTV in primary pDCs. The induction of IFN-α/β required endo-/lysosomal acidification and maturation. However, despite being an RNA virus, UV-BTV did not signal through Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) for IFN-α/β induction. In contrast, pathways involving the MyD88 adaptor and kinases dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) were implicated. This work highlights the importance of pDCs for the production of innate immunity cytokines induced by a dsRNA virus, and it shows that a dsRNA virus can induce IFN-α/β in pDCs via a novel TLR-independent and Myd88-dependent pathway. These findings have implications for the design of efficient vaccines against dsRNA viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Current recommendations for assessing animal wellbeing during euthanasia suggest that measuring neuroendocrine hormones—such as ACTH, noradrenaline, and adrenaline—is preferable to measuring corticosterone and blood glucose because of the sensitivity of neuroendocrine hormones to the acute stress associated with rapid methods of euthanasia. However, these neuroendocrine hormones can be stimulated in ways that confound interpretation of welfare assessment in euthanasia studies. Although this property does not negate the usefulness of neuroendocrine hormones as tools of assessment, it is important to differentiate the stress associated with the induction of anesthesia before the loss of consciousness (an animal wellbeing concern) with the physiologic responses that occur after the loss of consciousness (not an animal wellbeing concern). In this study, rats were anesthetized by using a ketamine–xylazine combination. Once the rats achieved a surgical plane of anesthesia, they were exposed to O(2), CO(2), or isoflurane, followed by terminal blood collection to assess concentrations of ACTH, noradrenaline, corticosterone, and blood glucose. Compared with animals exposed to O(2) or isoflurane, rats exposed to CO(2) had significant increases in their serum concentrations of ACTH and noradrenaline, but blood glucose and corticosterone did not differ between groups. These findings indicate that noradrenaline and ACTH should be used with caution to assess animal wellbeing when the method of euthanasia might confound that assessment.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Cryptosporidium spp. infections in neonatal dairy calves can cause diarrhoea and, in rare cases, death. The infection is usually self-limiting, but halofuginone lactate (HL) can be used prophylactically. Calves (n =144) in the study were born during a 2-month period on one farm. A total of 901 serum and 767 faecal samples were collected. Based on HL treatment, the calves were divided into 3 groups: I) not treated, II) treated incorrectly (treatment started >48h after birth, or lasted <7days), and III) treated correctly (started <48h after birth, and lasted ≥7days). Over the 3-month observation period, 14.6% (n =21) of the calves died, of which most (67%) had not been treated with HL. Correctly performed treatment of cryptosporidiosis significantly delayed the onset of oocysts shedding (P <0.001) and reduced haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations in the second week of life. HP concentration and HL treatment were negatively associated with weight gain at 3months of age. Cryptosporidium positive faecal samples were significantly (P <0.001) more likely to be diarrhoeic but Giardia or Eimeria positive samples were not. Correct prophylactic treatment with HL delayed the shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts and improved survival, but was negatively associated with weight gain. Incorrect treatment had a low impact on mortality and resembled no treatment regarding the proportion of calves shedding oocysts. Acute phase response (APR) in the second week of life seemed to be positively associated with shedding high amounts of Cryptosporidium oocysts.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can cause myocarditis, respiratory failure, reproductive failure, and sudden death in pre-weaned piglets, which has been isolated in China. EMCV VP1 protein was one of the most important structural proteins and played an important role in the protective immunity. In this study, 10 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against EMCV VP1 were screened and identified. RESULTS: Epitope mapping results indicated that McAbs (6E11, 7A7, 7C9) specifically recognized the linear epitopes V(2)ENAEK(7), McAbs (1D1, 2A2, 5A1, 5A11, 5G1) recognized the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25), and McAbs 1G8 and 3A9 recognized P(42)IGAFTVK(49). Protein sequence alignment of VP1 with 16 EMCV isolates indicated that the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25) was conserved in all the reference strains. The epitopes P(42)IGAFTVK(49) and V(2)ENAEK(7) only had 1 or 2 variable amino acid among the reference strains. The 3D model analysis results showed that these epitopes presented as spheres were shown within the context of the complete particle. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ten McAbs against EMCV VP1 were developed and three B-cells epitopes (2-7aa, 19-25aa and 42-49aa) were defined in VP1. All the results herein will promote the future investigations into the function of VP1 of EMCV and development of diagnostic methods of EMCV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: OBJECTIVE: Infections with the mosquito transmitted dengue virus (DENV) are a significant public health burden in many parts of the world. Despite the introduction of a commercial vaccine in some parts of the world, the majority of the populations at risk of infection remain unprotected against this disease, and there is currently no treatment for DENV infection. Natural compounds offer the prospect of cheap and sustainable therapeutics to reduce the disease burden during infection, and thus potentially alleviate the risk of more severe disease. This study evaluated the potential anti-DENV 2 activity of five natural compounds namely melatonin, α-tocopherol, folic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine and resveratrol in two different cell lines. RESULTS: Screening of the compounds showed that one compound (acetyl-l-carnitine) showed no effect on DENV infection, three compounds (melatonin, α-tocopherol and folic acid) slightly increased levels of infection, while the 5th compound, resveratrol, showed some limited anti-DENV activity, with resveratrol reducing virus output with an EC(50) of less than 25 μM. These results suggest that some commonly taken natural compounds may have beneficial effects on DENV infection, but that others may potentially add to the disease burden.

      "Error parsing: Autophagy is an essential cellular process affecting virus infections and other diseases and Beclin1 (BECN1) is one of its key regulators. Here, we identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but also reduce the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a promising target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV) causes fulminating enteritis that can result in a daily death rate of 20% in guinea fowl flocks. Here, we studied GfCoV diversity and evaluated its phenotypic consequences. Over the period of 2014 to 2016, affected guinea fowl flocks were sampled in France, and avian coronavirus presence was confirmed by PCR on intestinal content and immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue. Sequencing revealed 89% amino acid identity between the viral attachment protein S1 of GfCoV/2014 and that of the previously identified GfCoV/2011. To study the receptor interactions as a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity, recombinant S1 proteins were produced and analyzed by glycan and tissue arrays. Glycan array analysis revealed that, in addition to the previously elucidated biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc) receptor, viral attachment S1 proteins from GfCoV/2014 and GfCoV/2011 can bind to glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, recombinant GfCoV/2014 S1 has an increased affinity for these glycans compared to that of GfCoV/2011 S1, which was in agreement with the increased avidity of GfCoV/2014 S1 for gastrointestinal tract tissues. Enzymatic removal of receptors from tissues before application of spike proteins confirmed the specificity of S1 tissue binding. Overall, we demonstrate that diversity in GfCoV S1 proteins results in differences in glycan and tissue binding properties. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses cause major global problems in the poultry industry. As causative agents of huge economic losses, the detection and understanding of the molecular determinants of viral tropism are of ultimate importance. Here, we set out to study those parameters and obtained in-depth insight into the virus-host interactions of guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV). Our data indicate that diversity in GfCoV viral attachment proteins results in differences in degrees of affinity for glycan receptors, as well as altered avidity for intestinal tract tissues, which might have consequences for GfCoV tissue tropism and pathogenesis in guinea fowls.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola, are non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates. The sequence of events that leads to release of filovirus particles from cells is poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed, one proceeding via a “submarine-like” budding with the helical nucleocapsid emerging parallel to the plasma membrane, and the other via perpendicular “rocket-like” protrusion. Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape. They reconcile the contrasting models of filovirus budding and allow us to describe the sequence of events taking place during budding and release of Marburg virus. We propose that this represents a general sequence of events also followed by other filamentous and rod-shaped viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: In two recent articles from Huang C et al and Yang X in The Lancet,2,3 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed lymphopenia. The presence of lymphopenia as a signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Wang D et al, who, in their study published in JAMA, reported that ICU patients suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm,3 with non survivors exhibiting persistent lymphopenia.4 ICU patients present also with high levels of plasma cytokines.2 The existence of hyper-cytokinemia in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia could indicate a poor control of the pathogen, as showed in severe patients infected with the 2009 Pandemic Influenza virus. Interestingly, hypercytokinemia and lymphopenia were also evident in critical patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to the Coronavirus emerged in 2003 (SARS-CoV).5,6 These features (lymphopenia + hypercytokinemia) fit the characteristics of a particular immunological phenotype of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), which, as we recently demonstrated in an article published in the Journal of Infection, is associated with increased severity, mortality and a dysregulated immunological response.7 In their works, Yang X et al and Chen N et al propose a direct cytotoxic action of the virus to explain the low lymphocyte counts observed in the severe cases of COVID-19.3,8 But, in our opinion, host factors could also contribute to induce lymphopenia in these cases. Compared with those patients not requiring intensive care, COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU are older and are more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.4 Aging and chronic diseases induce chronic endothelial dysfunction. As we recently reviewed in J Clin Med, endothelial dysfunction induces disassembly of intercellular junctions, endothelial cell death and blood-tissue barrier disruption, along with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, which could contribute to explain the lymphopenia observed in severe COVID-19 patients.9 Recent findings from our group have evidenced the interconnection between lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAP and organ failure.10 Endothelial dysfunction induces also increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, glycocalyx degradation and shedding along with a pro-coagulant and anti-fibrinolytic state.9 In aged individuals with chronic diseases, these features could represent predisposing factors for presenting a severe respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Because of the poor prognosis of advanced melanoma there is an urgent need to identify new biomarkers to differentiate melanoma cells from normal melanocytes, to stratify patients according to their risk, and to identify subgroups of patients that require close follow-up or more aggressive therapy. Furthermore, melanoma progression has been associated with the dysregulation of cell adhesion molecules. We have reviewed the literature and have discussed the important role of the expression of the carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) in the development of melanoma.

Evidence suggests that AM precursors originate during embryogenesis and populate lungs without replenishment by circulating leukocytes. However, their presence and persistence are unclear following human lung transplantation (LTx). Our goal was to examine donor AM longevity and evaluate whether AM of recipient origin seeds the transplanted lungs. Origin of AM was accessed using donor-recipient HLA mismatches. We demonstrate that 94–100% of AM present in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were donor derived and importantly AM of recipient origin were not detected. Further, analysis of BAL cells up to 3.5 yrs post-LTx revealed that majority of AM (>87%) was donor derived. Elicitation of de novo donor specific antibody (DSA) is a major post-LTx complication and a risk factor for development of chronic rejection. The donor AM responded to anti-HLA framework Ab with secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Further, in an experimental murine model, we demonstrate that adoptive transfer of allogeneic AM stimulated humoral and cellular immune responses to alloantigen and lung-associated self-antigens and led to bronchiolar obstruction. Therefore, donor derived AM play an essential role in the DSA induced inflammatory cascade leading to obliterative airway disease of the transplanted lungs.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Mucins are present at the ocular surface in both secreted and membrane-bound forms. Mucins are produced in partby the conjunctial goblet cells, and are complemented by non-globet secretions. This review focuses on secreted ocular mucins. They are present in the tear film, probably both in gel and soluble form, and play a role in lubrication and ocular defense. It is apparent that mucins are highly adapted to their functions. State of the art techniques for mucin purification and analysis are presented. Density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis are discussed, together with methods of oliogosaccharide analysis. Reagents for the detection of mucin are considered in conjunction with these methods, which we have employed in the analysis of human and canine ocular mucins. The general structure of mucins is reviewed. The biosyntheas and glycosylation of ocular mucins are not yet fully understood, and are discussed in relation to currently established concepts. The impaact of disease on the nature and secretion of mucins is considered, as well as the physiological and pathological significance of mucus degradation.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

These are involved in a number of pathological conditions including tissue degenerative processes. In the present work, we report the synthesis and systematic evaluation of differently substituted chalcones, chalconesemicarbazones, and diarylpyrazolines on cathepsins B, H and L activity. It was found that after a preliminary screening as cysteine protease inhibitors, chalconesemicarbazones were better inhibitors to these cysteine proteases than diarylpyrazolines followed by chalcones. All the synthesized compounds were identified as the best inhibitors to cathepsin L followed by cathepsin B and then cathepsin H. The results are compared with docking studies and it was found that all the compounds resulted in decrease in energy while interacting with the active site of the enzyme.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Topography-induced twisted wind flows are frequently observed in Hong Kong due to the abundance existence of mountains. Observed twisted wind profiles are with larger wind twist angles and are confined to the lower 500m of the atmosphere, thus may impose significant effects on both structures and near-ground wind conditions. In order to investigate the influences of twisted wind flows on the pedestrian-level wind environment, two twisted wind profiles were simulated in a boundary layer wind tunnel by using 1.5m tall wooden vanes. The maximum guide angles of vanes were 15° and 30° at the ground level to represent two nominal yaw angles of ‘high’ and ‘extreme’ twisted wind flows. Simulated twisted wind profiles followed the power-law profile and have acceptable longitudinal and lateral turbulence power spectra similar to conventional wind flows. The yaw angle profiles were exponentially decayed with the height but had smaller maximum yaw angles than of the guide vanes. The evaluation of wind conditions near an isolated building and a row of buildings in twisted wind flows has displayed substantially modified flow features such as asymmetric wind speed distributions about the building centre line and reduced wind speeds in the passages between buildings.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract We have previously reported the generation of the attenuated KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3 virus by continuous propagation of highly virulent G2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Vero cells. The present study aimed to assess the safety of S DEL5/ORF3 and to evaluate its effectiveness as a live vaccine for prime-booster vaccinations. Reversion to virulence experiments revealed that the S DEL5/ORF3 strain retains its attenuated phenotype and genetic stability after five successive passages in susceptible piglets. Pregnant sows were primed orally with an S DEL5/ORF3 live vaccine and boosted intramuscularly twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 2-week intervals prior to parturition. This sow vaccination regimen completely protected nursing piglets against virulent G2b challenge, as evidenced by the increase in survival rate from 0% to 100% and the significant reduction in diarrhea intensity, including the amount and duration of PEDV fecal shedding. In addition, despite a 2–3 day period of weight loss in piglets from vaccinated sows after challenge, their daily weight gain was recovered at 7 days post-challenge and became similar to that of unchallenged pigs from unvaccinated sows over the course of the experiment. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were verified in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows with the prime-boost treatment and their offspring. Altogether, our data demonstrated that the attenuated S DEL5/ORF3 strain guarantees the safety to host animals with no reversion to virulence and is suitable as an effective primary live vaccine providing durable maternal lactogenic immunity for passive piglet protection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population. Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns.

A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies.

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pathogen in swine and is responsible for substantial economic losses. Previous studies suggest that the PEDV E protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process. However, the subcellular localization and other functions of PEDV E protein still require more research. METHODS: The subcellular localization and function of PEDV E protein were investigated by examining its effects on cell growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and cell survival. RESULTS: The results show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER, with small quantities localized in the nucleus. The PEDV E protein has no effect on the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) growth, cell cycle and cyclin A expression. The cells expressing PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV E protein induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated NF-κB which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and the nucleus and it can cause ER stress. The PEDV E protein had no effect on the IEC growth and cell cycle. In addition, the PEDV E protein is able to up-regulate IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In this study, we demonstrated that one of the MHV strains, MHV-S, did not synthesize mRNA 4 and made a smaller mRNA 5. Sequence analysis showed that the transcription initiation site for gene 4 of MHV-S was mutated from the consensus UCUAAAC to UUUAAAC, consistent with the idea that mutations in this region abolish mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, within gene 5 there were deletions totaling 307 nucleotides which deleted almost all of open reading frame 5a, but preserved open reading frame 5b of gene 5. Comparison of the growth of MHV-S with other MHV strains in DBT cells revealed no significant growth defect in MHV-S.

      "Error parsing: Publisher Summary This chapter describes the procedures of purification, concentration, and preservation of antigens. The most general concept to begin with is the most important—the microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group. Chromatography is considered to be the most effective means of producing purified preparations of virus proteins, this being achieved by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of 11 atypical pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among Chinese, and to determine whether or not there is an association between these pathogens and the severity of illness. METHODS: We conducted a surveillance study for CAP in 30 hospitals of Beijing. Epidemiological data and clinical specimens were systematically collected from enrolled CAP patients. The detection for 11 atypical pathogens [9 respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP)] was performed. Risk factors of severe CAP and death in Hospital were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 6,008 CAP patients [including 1,071 severe CAP (SCAP)] were enrolled. The overall detection rate of the 11 atypical pathogens was 42.4% among 1,925 child CAP (39.9% among 274 child SCAP), and 25.8% among 4,083 adult CAP (22.8% among 797 adult SCAP). The most frequent atypical pathogen among child SCAP was parainfluenza virus (10.2%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (8.4%). However, the most frequent atypical pathogen among adult SCAP was influenza virus (8.9%) followed by parainfluenza virus (3.8%). Multivariate analyses showed that the important predictors for SCAP were an age ≤9 years, an age ≥65 years and co-existing diseases. These factors, except an age ≤9 years, were also predictors of death in Hospital. None of these 11 atypical pathogens was included as the risk factors of SCAP or death in Hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Although these 11 atypical pathogens were the common causes of CAP (including SCAP) among Chinese, they were not observed to increase risks for SCAP or death in Hospital.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Standard assays used for influenza serology present certain practical issues, such as inter-laboratory variability, complex protocols and the necessity for handling certain virus strains in high biological containment facilities. In an attempt to address this, avian and human influenza HA pseudotyped retroviruses have been successfully employed in antibody neutralization assays. In this study we generated an equine influenza pseudotyped lentivirus for serological screening. This was achieved by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of an H3N8 subtype equine influenza virus strain, HIV gag-pol and firefly luciferase reporter genes and harvesting virus from supernatant. In order to produce infective pseudotype particles it was necessary to additionally co-transfect a plasmid encoding the TMPRSS2 endoprotease to cleave the HA. High titre pseudotype virus (PV) was then used in PV antibody neutralization assays (PVNAs) to successfully distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated equines. The sera were also screened by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay. There was a 65% correlation between the results of the two assays, with the PVNA assay appearing slightly more sensitive. Future work will extend the testing of the PVNA with a larger number of serum samples to assess sensitivity/specificity, inter/intra-laboratory variability and to define a protective titre.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

The individual had landed at Lagos airport 2 days earlier on a flight from northern Italy, and had subsequently travelled from Lagos to Ogun State, western Nigeria, where he became ill and was promptly isolated. He is currently being treated for mild symptoms of COVID-19 in a hospital in Lagos. Upon identifying the index case, National Emergency Operations Centres were immediately activated to trace his contacts. By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nigeria—Lagos and Rivers State—of whom eight died of Ebola.2 The dense population of Lagos, its overstrained infrastructure, and the fact that it is a major regional transit hub for air, land, and sea transport created the perfect conditions for the spread of Ebola.

      "Error parsing: Despite utilizing the same chymotrypsin fold to host the catalytic machinery, coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) noticeably differ from picornavirus 3C proteases in acquiring an extra helical domain in evolution. Previously, the extra domain was demonstrated to regulate the catalysis of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro by controlling its dimerization. Here, we studied N214A, another mutant with only a doubled dissociation constant but significantly abolished activity. Unexpectedly, N214A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Thus, we conducted 30-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for N214A, WT, and R298A which we previously characterized to be a monomer with the collapsed catalytic machinery. Remarkably, three proteases display distinctive dynamical behaviors. While in WT, the catalytic machinery stably retains in the activated state; in R298A it remains largely collapsed in the inactivated state, thus implying that two states are not only structurally very distinguishable but also dynamically well separated. Surprisingly, in N214A the catalytic dyad becomes dynamically unstable and many residues constituting the catalytic machinery jump to sample the conformations highly resembling those of R298A. Therefore, the N214A mutation appears to trigger the dramatic change of the enzyme dynamics in the context of the dimeric form which ultimately inactivates the catalytic machinery. The present MD simulations represent the longest reported so far for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, unveiling that its catalysis is critically dependent on the dynamics, which can be amazingly modulated by the extra domain. Consequently, mediating the dynamics may offer a potential avenue to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Strain v2163 increased IL-1α, IL-6, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and RANTES in mice, and high IL-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication.

The pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 virus (A/2009/H1N1) finally arrived, causing the first pandemic influenza of the new millennium, which has affected over 214 countries and caused over 18,449 deaths. Because of the persistent threat from the A/H5N1 virus since 1997 and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, medical and scientific communities have been more prepared in mindset and infrastructure. This preparedness has allowed for rapid and effective research on the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the disease, with impacts on its control. A PubMed search using the keywords “pandemic influenza virus H1N1 2009” yielded over 2,500 publications, which markedly exceeded the number published on previous pandemics. Only representative works with relevance to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases are reviewed in this article. A significant increase in the understanding of this virus and the disease within such a short amount of time has allowed for the timely development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and preventive measures. These findings could prove useful for future randomized controlled clinical trials and the epidemiological control of future pandemics.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Leading into the International Polar Year 2007–2008, we outline approaches, protocols, and empirical models derived from a decade of integrated research on northern host–parasite systems. Investigations of emerging infectious diseases associated with parasites in northern wildlife involved a network of multidisciplinary collaborators and incorporated geographic surveys, archival collections, historical foundations for diversity, and laboratory and field studies exploring the interface for hosts, parasites, and the environment. In this system, emergence of parasitic disease was linked to geographic expansion, host switching, resurgence due to climate change, and newly recognized parasite species. Such integrative approaches serve as cornerstones for detection, prediction, and potential mitigation of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and persons in the North and elsewhere under a changing global climate.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: We are currently faced with a global infectious disease crisis which has been anticipated for decades. While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor signaling dampens the functionality of T cells faced with repetitive antigenic stimulation from chronic infections or tumors. Using intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation with mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we have shown that CD8 T cells establish a PD-1(hi), tissue-resident memory population in the brains (bT(RM)) of mice with a low-level persistent infection. In MuPyV encephalitis, PD-L1 was expressed on infiltrating myeloid cells, microglia and astrocytes, but not on oligodendrocytes. Engagement of PD-1 on anti-MuPyV CD8 T cells limited their effector activity. NanoString gene expression analysis showed that neuroinflammation was higher in PD-L1(−/−) than wild type mice at day 8 post-infection, the peak of the MuPyV-specific CD8 response. During the persistent phase of infection, however, the absence of PD-1 signaling was found to be associated with a lower inflammatory response than in wild type mice. Genetic disruption and intracerebroventricular blockade of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increase in number of MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) and the fraction of these cells expressing CD103, the αE integrin commonly used to define tissue-resident T cells. However, PD-L1(−/−) mice persistently infected with MuPyV showed impaired virus control upon i.c. re-infection with MuPyV. Collectively, these data reveal a temporal duality in PD-1-mediated regulation of MuPyV-associated neuroinflammation. PD-1 signaling limited the severity of neuroinflammation during acute infection but sustained a level of inflammation during persistent infection for maintaining control of virus re-infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The calicivirus minor capsid protein VP2 is expressed via termination/reinitiation. This process depends on an upstream sequence element denoted termination upstream ribosomal binding site (TURBS). We have shown for feline calicivirus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus that the TURBS contains three sequence motifs essential for reinitiation. Motif 1 is conserved among caliciviruses and is complementary to a sequence in the 18 S rRNA leading to the model that hybridization between motif 1 and 18 S rRNA tethers the post-termination ribosome to the mRNA. Motif 2 and motif 2* are proposed to establish a secondary structure positioning the ribosome relative to the start site of the terminal ORF. Here, we analyzed human norovirus (huNV) sequences for the presence and importance of these motifs. The three motifs were identified by sequence analyses in the region upstream of the VP2 start site, and we showed that these motifs are essential for reinitiation of huNV VP2 translation. More detailed analyses revealed that the site of reinitiation is not fixed to a single codon and does not need to be an AUG, even though this codon is clearly preferred. Interestingly, we were able to show that reinitiation can occur at AUG codons downstream of the canonical start/stop site in huNV and feline calicivirus but not in rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus. Although reinitiation at the original start site is independent of the Kozak context, downstream initiation exhibits requirements for start site sequence context known for linear scanning. These analyses on start codon recognition give a more detailed insight into this fascinating mechanism of gene expression.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has only recently been described. We provide individual patient data on the clinical course, treatment and complications experienced by 14 front-line health care workers and hospital support staff in Toronto who were diagnosed with SARS, and we provide follow-up information for up to 3 weeks after their discharge from hospital. METHODS: As part of the initial response to the SARS outbreak in Toronto, our health care centre was asked to establish a SARS unit for health care workers who were infected. Patients were admitted to this unit and were closely monitored and treated until they were well enough to be discharged. We prospectively compiled information on their clinical course, management and complications and followed them for 3 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: The 11 women and 3 men described here (mean age 42 [standard deviation {SD} 9] years) were all involved in providing medical or ancillary hospital services to patients who were later found to have SARS. Onset of symptoms in 4 of our patients who could clearly identify only a single contact with a patient with SARS occurred on average 4 (SD 3) days after exposure. For the remaining 10 patients with multiple patient contacts, symptom onset followed exposure by a mean of 3.5 (SD 3) days after their exposure. All patients were treated with ribavirin, and all patients received levofloxacin. Many experienced major complications. Dyspnea was present in 12 patients during their stay in hospital, and all developed abnormalities on chest radiograph; 3 patients developed severe hypoxemia (PaO(2) < 50 mm Hg). All patients experienced a drop in hemoglobin. Nine patients had hemolytic anemia. Three patients experienced numbness and tingling in their hands and feet, and 2 developed frank tetany. All 3 had magnesium levels that were less than 0.1 mmol/L. All patients recovered and were discharged home. At a follow-up examination 3 weeks after discharge (5 weeks after onset of illness), all patients were no longer weak but continued to become fatigued easily and had dyspnea on minimal exertion. For 5 patients, chest radiographs still showed residual disease. INTERPRETATION: SARS is a very serious illness even in healthy, relatively young people. The clinical course in our patients, all of whom met the case definition for SARS (which requires pulmonary involvement), resulted in dyspnea and, in some individuals, severe hypoxemia. Severe hemolytic anemia may be a feature of SARS or may be a complication of therapy, possibly with ribavirin.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

In this paper we propose two new correlation-related distance metrics to replace the old one in our dynamical language approach. Four genome datasets are employed to evaluate the effects of this replacement from a biological point of view. We find that the two proper distance metrics yield trees with the same or similar topologies as/to those using the old “distance” and agree with the tree of life based on 16S rRNA in a majority of the basic branches. Hence the two proper correlation-related distance metrics proposed here improve our dynamical language approach for phylogenetic analysis.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: ABSTRACT Background That ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can be reduced by continuous and/or intermittent subglottic suction highlights the importance of clearance of oropharyngeal secretions. We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change in reducing VAP. Methods A time-sequence nonrandomized intervention design was used. The study consisted of a 9-month observation phase (control group, 237 patients), a 6-month education phase, followed by a 7-month intervention phase (studied group, 227 patients). The occurrence of VAP, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality were recorded. Results VAP occurred less frequently in the studied group (6 of 227 patients, 2.6%) than in the control group (26 of 237 patients, 11.0%; P < 0.001). The incidence rate of VAP in control and studied groups was 6.51 and 2.04 per 1000 ventilator days, respectively (P =0.002). For VAP patients, the ventilator days were 28.8 ± 17.2days and 20.2 ± 4.0days (P =0.009), respectively, and the length of ICU stay was 27.6 ± 17.0days and 20.3 ± 4.0days (P =0.012), respectively, in the control and studied groups. Intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change was the only independent factor responsible for a decrease of VAP in the studied group after stepwise logistic regression analysis (P =0.003).

      "Error parsing: Abstract Worldwide, acute respiratory infections (ARIs) constitute the leading cause of acute illnesses, being responsible for nearly 4million deaths every year, mostly in young children and infants in developing countries. The main infectious agents responsible for ARIs include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. While effective vaccines against influenza, H. influenzae type b (Hib) and S. pneumoniae infections have been available for several years, no vaccine is available at present against illnesses caused by RSV, PIV-3, metapneumovirus or any of the three novel coronaviruses. In addition, the threat constituted by the multiple outbreaks of avian influenza during the last few years is urgently calling for the development of new influenza vaccines with broader spectrum of efficacy, which could provide immunity against an avian influenza virus pandemic. This article reviews the state of the art in vaccine R&D against ARIs and attempts to address these basic public health questions.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: During infection, many RNA viruses produce characteristic inclusion bodies that contain both viral and host components. These structures were first described over a century ago and originally termed “X-bodies,” as their function was not immediately appreciated. Whilst some inclusion bodies may represent cytopathic by-products of viral protein over-accumulation, X-bodies have emerged as virus “factories,” quasi-organelles that coordinate diverse viral infection processes such as replication, protein expression, evasion of host defenses, virion assembly, and intercellular transport. Accordingly, they are now generally referred to as viral replication complexes (VRCs). We previously used confocal fluorescence microscopy to unravel the complex structure of X-bodies produced by Potato virus X (PVX). Here we used 3D-structured illumination (3D-SIM) super-resolution microscopy to map the PVX X-body at a finer scale. We identify a previously unrecognized membrane structure induced by the PVX “triple gene block” (TGB) proteins, providing new insights into the complex interplay between virus and host within the X-body.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Issues Les exposés de cas issus d’Asie laissent entendre que les issues maternelles et fœtales sont aggravées par la présence du SRAS pendant la grossesse. Résultats Des recherches ont été menées dans Medline afin d’en tirer les articles pertinents publiés en anglais entre 2000 et 2007. Des exposés de cas ont été analysés et nous avons sollicité l’opinion de spécialistes. Valeurs Les recommandations ont été formulées conformément aux lignes directrices élaborées par le Groupe d’étude canadien sur les soins de santé préventifs. Commanditaire La Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada. Recommandations 1. Tous les hôpitaux devraient mettre en œuvre des systèmes de prévention des infections, afin de s’assurer que des alertes au sujet des modifications que connaissent les facteurs de risque d’exposition au SRAS ou à d’autres maladies transmissibles potentiellement graves sont communiquées sans tarder aux unités cliniques, y compris l’unité de travail et d’accouchement (III-C). 2. En présence d’une éclosion de SRAS, toutes les patientes enceintes évaluées ou admises à l’hôpital devraient faire l’objet d’un dépistage des symptômes et des facteurs de risque du SRAS (III-C). 3. À leur arrivée au sein de l’unité de triage quant au travail, les patientes enceintes chez lesquelles la présence du SRAS est soupçonnée et probable devraient être placées dans une salle d’isolement dotée d’un système de ventilation à pression négative comptant au moins six renouvellements d’air à l’heure. Toutes les unités de travail et d’accouchement offrant des soins à des patientes chez lesquelles la présence du SRAS est soupçonnée et probable devraient disposer d’au moins une salle dans laquelle ces patientes peuvent connaître leur travail et leur accouchement en toute sûreté, et ce, malgré la nécessité d’assurer un isolement aérogène (III-C). 4. Dans la mesure du possible, le travail et l’accouchement (y compris l’accouchement opératoire ou la césarienne) devraient être pris en charge, dans une salle d’isolement désignée dotée d’un système de ventilation à pression négative, par du personnel désigné disposant d’une tenue de protection et d’une formation spécialisée en prévention des infections (III-C). 5. Tant l’anesthésie régionale que générale peuvent s’avérer adéquates pour l’accouchement des patientes atteintes du SRAS (III-C). 6. Les nouveau-nés issus de mères atteintes du SRAS devraient être isolés au sein d’une unité désignée jusqu’à ce que leur état ait été satisfaisant pendant 10 jours ou jusqu’à ce que la période d’isolement de la mère ait pris fin. La mère ne devrait pas allaiter pendant cette période (III-C). 7. Une équipe multidisciplinaire (comprenant des obstétriciens, des infirmières, des pédiatres, des spécialistes de la prévention des infections, des inhalothérapeutes et des anesthésiologistes) devrait être nommée au sein de chaque unité et être responsable de l’organisation et de la mise en œuvre des protocoles de prise en charge du SRAS de l’unité (III-C). 8. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS ne devraient pas offrir leurs services aux autres patientes enceintes. Le personnel offrant des soins aux patientes enceintes atteintes du SRAS devraient activement faire l’objet d’une surveillance visant la fièvre et d’autres symptômes du SRAS. Ces personnes ne devraient pas travailler en présence de tout symptôme du SRAS se manifestant dans les 10 jours suivant une exposition à un patient atteint du SRAS (III-C). 9. Tous les professionnels des soins de santé, les résidents et les membres du personnel de soutien devraient bénéficier d’une formation sur la prise en charge et le confinement des infections afin de prévenir la propagation du virus du SRAS (III-A). 10. Les autorités sanitaires régionales, conjointement avec le personnel hospitalier, devraient envisager la désignation d’établissements ou d’unités de soins de santé particulières (y compris des centres de soins primaires, secondaires ou tertiaires) en ce qui concerne l’offre de soins aux patients atteints du SRAS ou de maladies semblables (III-A).: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection causes significant economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide and still represents a huge pressure on agricultural production. Thus, the development of novel anti-BVDV strategies are urgently needed. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5B) of BVDV is essential for viral replication. Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). Further, an MDBK cell line stably expressing Nb1 was established to explore antiviral activity. Results showed that Nb1 could markedly suppress BVDV replication and interact with the BVDV NS5B protein. This suggests that nanobodies have potential for the development of novel antiviral drugs against BVDV infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Croup is an acute viral respiratory infection with upper airway mucosal inflammation that may cause respiratory distress. Most cases are mild. Moderate to severe croup may require treatment with corticosteroids (from which benefits are often delayed) and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) (which may be short‐lived and can cause dose‐related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension). Rarely, croup results in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation. A mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates by reducing the viscosity of the inhaled air. It is currently used during emergency transport of children with severe croup. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it relieves respiratory distress. This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2013. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of heliox compared to oxygen or other active interventions, placebo, or no treatment, on relieving signs and symptoms in children with croup as determined by a croup score and rates of admission and intubation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; and LILACS in January and February 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) on 8 February 2018. We contacted British Oxygen Company, a leading supplier of heliox (BOC Australia 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing the effect of heliox in comparison with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported data that could not be pooled for statistical analysis descriptively. MAIN RESULTS: We included 3 RCTs with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. Study duration was from 7 to 16 months; all studies were conducted in emergency departments in the USA (two studies) and Spain. Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen. Risk of bias was low in two studies and high in one study due to an open‐label design. We added no new trials for this update. One study of 15 children with mild croup compared heliox with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes. There may be no difference in croup score changes between groups at 20 minutes (mean difference (MD) ‐0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.36 to 0.70). The mean croup score at 20 minutes postintervention may not differ between groups (MD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐1.46 to 0.32). There may be no difference between groups in mean respiratory rate (MD 6.40, 95% CI ‐1.38 to 14.18) and mean heart rate (MD 14.50, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 37.49) at 20 minutes. The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision. All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation, or re‐presenting to emergency departments was not reported. In another study, 47 children with moderate croup received one dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) with either heliox for 60 minutes or no treatment. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 60 minutes postintervention (MD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐1.96 to ‐0.24), but there may be no difference between groups at 120 minutes (MD ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐4.86 to 3.46). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean Taussig croup scores at 60 minutes (MD ‐1.11, 95% CI ‐2.05 to ‐0.17) but not at 120 minutes (MD ‐0.71, 95% CI ‐1.72 to 0.30). Children treated with heliox may have lower mean respiratory rates at 60 minutes (MD ‐4.94, 95% CI ‐9.66 to ‐0.22), but there may be no difference at 120 minutes (MD ‐3.17, 95% CI ‐7.83 to 1.49). There may be no difference in hospitalisation rates between groups (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open‐label design. Information on heart rate and intubation was not reported. In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup received intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) and either heliox with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of adrenaline for three hours. Heliox may slightly improve croup scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re‐presenting to the emergency department was not reported. The included studies did not report on adverse events, intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety. We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen for children with mild croup, but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup treated with dexamethasone. The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline. Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Experiments were set up to assess the effects of ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ stresses on the re-excretion of infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) virus in latently infected chickens recovered from the acute phase of the disease. The stresses were rehousing with the addition of ilt-free contact birds, corticosteroid treatment and the onset of lay. The contact birds were also monitored for transmission of the virus from the carrier birds. Rehousing with unfamiliar birds induced ilt virus shedding in one of five birds and there was evidence of transmission from this bird to its mate. The onset of lay had a significant effect on the overall shedding rates of the carrier birds. Nine of 10 birds shed virus after onset of lay compared with only two in the three-and-a-half weeks before, and there was a highly significant increase (P<0·001) in the overall number of virus isolations during this period. Corticosteroid treatment did not affect virus shedding.

      "Error parsing: [Image: see text] Recognition of psychostimulants such as cocaine and the amphetamines by the dopamine transporter (DAT) protein is principally responsible for the euphoria and addiction associated with these drugs. Using as a template the crystal structure of a distantly related bacterial leucine transporter, we have generated 3-D DAT computer molecular models. Ligand docking to such models has revealed potential substrate and inhibitor binding pockets, subsequently confirmed by in vitro pharmacology. An inhibitor pocket defined by the DAT model to be within the “extracellular vestibule”, just to the extracellular side of the external gate of the primary substrate pocket, was used for virtual screening of a structural library of compounds. High-throughput docking and application of pharmacophore constraints within this vestibular inhibitor pocket identified a compound structurally dissimilar to the classic monoamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) transporter (MAT) inhibitors. The compound displaced binding of radiolabeled cocaine analogs at all three MATs, usually with nanomolar K(i) values and within 2-fold of cocaine’s affinity at the norepinephrine transporter. Although a very weak dopamine uptake inhibitor itself, this compound reduced by 3-fold the potency of cocaine in inhibiting DAT-mediated cellular uptake of dopamine. To our knowledge, the present findings are the first to successfully employ “receptor-based” computer modeling to identify moderate- to high-affinity MAT ligands. In silico ligand screening using MAT models provides a rapid, low-cost discovery process that should accelerate identification of novel ligand scaffolds and provide lead compounds in combating psychostimulant addiction and in treating other monoamine-related CNS diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: In endemic countries such as Bangladesh, consequences of cholera place an enormous financial and social burden on patients and their families. Cholera vaccines not only provide health benefits to susceptible populations but also have effects on the earning capabilities and financial stability of the family. Community-based research and evaluations are necessary to understand perceptions about and practices of the community relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccines. This may help identify the ways in which such vaccines may be successfully introduced, and other preventive measures can be implemented. The present study assessed the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preventive practices relating to cholera and oral cholera vaccine among an urban population residing in a high cholera-prone setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an area of high cholera prevalence in 15 randomly-selected clusters in Mirpur, Dhaka city. A study team collected data through a survey and in-depth interviews during December 2010–February 2011. RESULTS: Of 2,830 families included in the final analysis, 23% could recognize cholera as acute watery diarrhea and 16% had ever heard of oral cholera vaccine. About 54% of the respondents had poor knowledge about cholera-related issues while 97% had a positive attitude toward cholera and oral cholera vaccine. One-third showed poor practice relating to the prevention of cholera. The findings showed a significant (p < 0.05) association between the respondents’ knowledge and sex, education, occupation, monthly overall household expenditure, attitudes and practice. In the adjusted model, male sex, having a lower monthly overall household expenditure, and having a less positive attitude toward cholera were the significant predictors to having poor knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the strengthening of health education activities to improve knowledge on cholera, its prevention and treatment and information on cholera vaccination among high-risk populations. The data also underscore the potential of mass cholera vaccination to prevent and control cholera.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: More knowledge about viral populations in wild animals is needed in order to better understand and assess the risk of zoonotic diseases. In this study we performed viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from three healthy carnivores: a badger (Meles meles), a mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) and an otter (Lutra lutra) from Portugal. RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses. Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger. In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease. Our study expands the knowledge of viral species present in the gut, although the interpretation of the true host species of such novel viruses needs to be reviewed with great caution.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Measles caused by a paramyxovirus, characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza conjunctivitis, a maculopapular rash is known to result in pneumonia, encephalitis and death. Fatal cases of measles in Sri Lanka are rare after implementation of the National Immunization Programme in 1984. Thereafter 0.1% case fatality rate was observed during October 1999–June 2000 which is a very low figure compared to other regional countries. Immunization guidelines were further revised in 2001, 2011 and in 2012 when additional immunization was recommended to age group 4–21 years; who are likely to have inadequate immunization, in order to achieve elimination of Measles by 2020. However, in 2013–2014, 4690 cases were reported and the majority were children less than 1 year of age. The occurrence in adults is hard to retrieve in published epidemiological reports, however had been 38% (out of 1008 patients) in the 3rd quarter of 2013. During this outbreak 73/101 (72%) reported from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka had been more than 12 years of age with 50% being more than 29 years. 14 Sri lankan adult patients [median age 32 years (range 25–48)] who presented sporadically from June 2014 to March 2016, with confirmed measles infection were enrolled retrospectively after informed consent. Details with regards to their clinical presentation, immunization and other relevant areas were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire or using patient management records. RESULTS: The patients presented with high fever, headache, severe body aches, sore throat, dry cough, intense tearing, red eyes and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy over 3–5 days duration. Later they developed discrete maculopapular rash helping the diagnosis. They had a variable degree of leucopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and derangements in the liver functions mimicking any other acute febrile illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, leptospirosis or Zika virus infection. CONCLUSION: At least a 3–5 day delay in the diagnosis was observed (even after the appearance of the rash in some patients), due to non-awareness of its occurrence, unfamiliarity of measles in adults, non-specific nature of the illness and non-availability of rapid diagnostics, risking transmission to the immune-compromised or non-immune staff or patients. Identification of the source of infection in these sporadic adult cases and their virologic surveillance and molecular epidemiology will be important to interrupt the transmission and to achieve the targeted elimination of measles from Sri Lanka by 2020.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary Background Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304–130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

      "Error parsing: Abstract Visibility in Hong Kong has deteriorated significantly over 40 years with visibility below 8km in the absence of fog, mist, or precipitation, increasing from 6.6 days in 1968 to 54.1 days in 2007. We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996–2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5km decrease in visibility at lag0–1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure–response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We retrospectively analyzed the response of 100 emergency departments regarding use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and implementation of infection control measures (ICMs) during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan. Emergency department workers in large hospitals were more severely affected by the epidemic. Large hospitals or public hospitals were more likely to use respirators. Small hospitals implemented more restrictive ICMs. Most emergency departments provided PPE (80%) and implemented ICMs (66%) at late stages of the outbreak. Instructions to use PPE or ICMs more frequently originated by emergency department administrators. The difficulty of implementing ICMs was significantly negatively correlated with their effectiveness. Because ability to prepare for and respond to emerging infectious diseases varies among hospitals, grouping infectious patients in a centralized location in an early stage of infection may reduce the extent of epidemics.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) serotypes 1–9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds worldwide. APMV-1 (also called Newcastle disease virus, NDV) is attenuated in non-human primates and is being developed as a candidate human vaccine vector. The vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown. In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically- or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model. Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9. Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4. The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion. Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5. Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals. Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7. Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4. All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals. None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs. These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype. This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: T cell memory is usually studied in the context of infection with a single pathogen in naive mice, but how memory develops during a coinfection with two pathogens, as frequently occurs in nature or after vaccination, is far less studied. Here, we questioned how the competition between immune responses to two viruses in the same naive host would influence the development of CD8 T cell memory and subsequent disease outcome upon challenge. Using two different models of coinfection, including the well-studied lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) and Pichinde (PICV) viruses, several differences were observed within the CD8 T cell responses to either virus. Compared to single-virus infection, coinfection resulted in substantial variation among mice in the size of epitope-specific T cell responses to each virus. Some mice had an overall reduced number of virus-specific cells to either one of the viruses, and other mice developed an immunodominant response to a normally subdominant, cross-reactive epitope (nucleoprotein residues 205 to 212, or NP205). These changes led to decreased protective immunity and enhanced pathology in some mice upon challenge with either of the original coinfecting viruses. In mice with PICV-dominant responses, during a high-dose challenge with LCMV clone 13, increased immunopathology was associated with a reduced number of LCMV-specific effector memory CD8 T cells. In mice with dominant cross-reactive memory responses, during challenge with PICV increased immunopathology was directly associated with these cross-reactive NP205-specific CD8 memory cells. In conclusion, the inherent competition between two simultaneous immune responses results in significant alterations in T cell immunity and subsequent disease outcome upon reexposure. IMPORTANCE Combination vaccines and simultaneous administration of vaccines are necessary to accommodate required immunizations and maintain vaccination rates. Antibody responses generally correlate with protection and vaccine efficacy. However, live attenuated vaccines also induce strong CD8 T cell responses, and the impact of these cells on subsequent immunity, whether beneficial or detrimental, has seldom been studied, in part due to the lack of known T cell epitopes to vaccine viruses. We questioned if the inherent increased competition and stochasticity between two immune responses during a simultaneous coinfection would significantly alter CD8 T cell memory in a mouse model where CD8 T cell epitopes are clearly defined. We show that some of the coinfected mice have sufficiently altered memory T cell responses that they have decreased protection and enhanced immunopathology when reexposed to one of the two viruses. These data suggest that a better understanding of human T cell responses to vaccines is needed to optimize immunization strategies.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract New approaches are urgently needed to evaluate potential hazards posed by exposure to nanomaterials. Gene expression profiling provides information on potential modes of action and human relevance, and tools have recently become available for pathway-based quantitative risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162μg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, dose–response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The binding of viruses to host cells is the first step in determining tropism and pathogenicity. While avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) infection and avian influenza A virus (IAV) infection both depend on α2,3-linked sialic acids, the host tropism of IBV is restricted compared to that of IAV. Here we investigated whether the interaction between the viral attachment proteins and the host could explain these differences by using recombinant spike domains (S1) of IBV strains with different pathogenicities, as well as the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of IAV H5N1. Protein histochemistry showed that S1 of IBV strain M41 and HA of IAV subtype H5N1 displayed sialic acid-dependent binding to chicken respiratory tract tissue. However, while HA bound with high avidity to a broad range of α2,3-linked sialylated glycans, M41 S1 recognized only one particular α2,3-linked disialoside in a glycan array. When comparing the binding of recombinant IBV S1 proteins derived from IBV strains with known differences in tissue tropism and pathogenicity, we observed that while M41 S1 displayed binding to cilia and goblet cells of the chicken respiratory tract, S1 derived from the vaccine strain H120 or the nonvirulent Beaudette strain had reduced or no binding to chicken tissues, respectively, in agreement with the reduced abilities of these viruses to replicate in vivo. While the S1 protein derived from the nephropathogenic IBV strain B1648 also hardly displayed binding to respiratory tract cells, distinct binding to kidney cells was observed, but only after the removal of sialic acid from S1. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the attachment patterns of the IBV S proteins correlate with the tropisms and pathogenicities of the corresponding viruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

In this study, the nsp13 gene was cloned from the SARS-CoV PUMC02 strain viral RNA by RT-PCR, and inserted into the expression plasmid pET30a(+). The recombinant plasmid pET30a(+)-nsp13 was confirmed by restriction enzymes and sequencing analysis, and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The His-tag-fused protein was expressed by induction of 0.5mM IPTG and purified by a single Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The protein was validated by western blot and MS analysis. A large quantity of the nsp13 protein obtained with this method may be useful for further study of its structure and function.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are retroviruses with a global impact on the health of domestic cats. The two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease. FIV can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of developing opportunistic infections, neurological diseases, and tumors. In most naturally infected cats, however, FIV itself does not cause severe clinical signs, and FIV-infected cats may live many years without any health problems. FeLV is more pathogenic, and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats. FeLV can cause tumors (mainly lymphoma), bone marrow suppression syndromes (mainly anemia) and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system. Today, FeLV is less important as a deadly infectious agent as in the last 20 years prevalence has been decreasing in most countries.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background Cardiac catheterization (CATH) is key in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease. Increasing demand coupled with limited resources in a publicly funded system (e.g. Ontario, the largest province in Canada) resulted in a waitlist for this procedure. Our province has recommended maximum wait times (RMWT) for patients referred to CATH. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience over the past decade in attempting to meet RMWTs for patients needing CATH at our centre, and to discuss issues concerning capacity planning in providing timely service. Methods We measured the proportion of patients undergoing a procedure within the RWMT, and calculated both the mean number of patients and mean length of time on the wait list for each year over a decade for those referred to CATH using prospectively collected registry data. We identified factors that increased referrals or improved capacity. Wait time was compared to community standard RMWTs in order to establish if and how RMWTs were achieved. Results Despite a number of systematic and capacity improvements, RMWTs were not achieved until after the addition of a 4th laboratory. Interpretation Improving access to CATH in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Registry data can help monitor key indicators (e.g. RMWT). Prudent use of this information should help policy makers with future expansion in our region.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) helps protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from pathogens and prevents cross-contamination. PPE effectiveness is often undermined by inappropriate doffing methods. Our knowledge of how HCWs approach doffing PPE in practice is limited. In this qualitative study, we examine HCWs’ perspectives about doffing PPE. METHODS: Thirty participants at a Midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios: 3 mask designs (n = 10), 2 gown designs (n = 10), or 2 glove designs (n = 10). Participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. Their performances were video-recorded and reviewed with participants. Semistructured interviews about their doffing approaches were conducted and audio-recorded, then transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were identified in interviews: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off). Cognitive processes during doffing largely pertained to tracking contaminated PPE surfaces, examining PPE design cues (eg, straps), or improvising based on prior experience from training or similar PPE designs. Doffing barriers and facilitators typically related to PPE design, such as PPE fit (or lack of it) and fastener type. Some participants also described personal barriers (eg, glasses, long hair); however, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve HCWs’ doffing performance need to address HCWs’ preferences for both safety and expediency when using PPE, which has implications for PPE design, training approaches, and hospital policies and procedures.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to obtain a natural antibiotic from Phenol-rich compounds; for the dressing and the treatment of chronic wounds. METHODS: The Phenol-rich compound sweet gel was prepared by blending four natural herbal extracts, Acacia catechu (L.F.), Momia (Shilajit), Castanea sativa, and Ephedra sinica stapf, with combination of a sweet gel medium, including honey, maple saps, Phoenix dactylifera L. (date), pomegranate extract and Azadirachta indica gum as a stabilizer. The combinations were screened by using a well-diffusion assay with cloxacillin as a control. Pseudomonas spp. was tested with our novel antimicrobial compound. The zones of inhibition in agar culture were measured for each individual component and for the compound, and the results were compared with those of the control group which had been treated with cloxacillin. Data were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Quantitative analyses were performed using the paired t-test. RESULTS: The antibiotic effect of the Phenol-rich compound sweet gel was statistically shown to be more significant than that of cloxacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our novel approach to fighting the antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas proved to be successful. The Phenol-rich compound sweet gel was found to be suitable for use as an alternative medicine and bioactive dressing material, for the treatment of patients with various types of wounds, including burns, venous leg ulcers, ulcers of various etiologies, leg ulcers on the feet of diabetic, unhealed graft sampling sites, abscesses, boils, surgical wounds, necrotic process, post-operative and neonatal wound infection, and should be considered as an alternative to the usual methods of cure.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important virus found in adult hospitalized patients. Objectives To study the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 15 years and diagnosed with RSV infection. Study design Both retrospective and prospective cohort studies were conducted at a university hospital between May 2014 and December 2015. Results: RSV was detected in 86 of 1562(5.5%) adult hospitalized patients suspected of respiratory viral infection. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. RSV was detected by RT-PCR (82.6%), IFA (10.1%), and both RT-PCR and IFA (7.3%). Most patients (87.0%) were aged ≥ 50 years. Cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, immunocompromised hosts, and diabetes were the major comorbidities. The common manifestations were cough (92.8%), dyspnea (91.3%), sputum production (87.0%), tachypnea (75.4%), wheezing (73.9%), and fever (71.0%). Fifty- five patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 92%) was found in 53.6% patients. Twenty-five of 69(36.2%) patients developed respiratory failure and required ventilatory support. Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients. Congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (MI), new atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia were found in 9(13.0%), 7(10.1%), 4(5.8%), and 3(4.3%) of 69 patients, respectively. Overall mortality was 15.9%. Pneumonia (81.8%) and acute MI (18.2%) were the major causes of death. Conclusions Most adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection were of advanced age and had comorbidities. Cardiopulmonary complications were the major causes of death. Management and prevention of RSV infection in these vulnerable groups are necessary.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The C-type lectin DC-SIGNR (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin-related; also known as L-SIGN or CD299) is a promising drug target due to its ability to promote infection and/or within-host survival of several dangerous pathogens (e.g. HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS)) via interactions with their surface glycans. Crystallography has provided excellent insight into the mechanism by which DC-SIGNR interacts with small glycans, such as (GlcNAc)(2)Man(3); however, direct observation of complexes with larger, physiological oligosaccharides, such as Man(9)GlcNAc(2), remains elusive. We have utilized solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate DC-SIGNR binding and herein report the first backbone assignment of its active, calcium-bound carbohydrate recognition domain. Direct interactions with the small sugar fragments Man(3), Man(5), and (GlcNAc)(2)Man(3) were investigated alongside Man(9)GlcNAc derived from recombinant gp120 (present on the HIV viral envelope), providing the first structural data for DC-SIGNR in complex with a virus-associated ligand, and unique binding modes were observed for each glycan. In particular, our data show that DC-SIGNR has a different binding mode for glycans on the HIV viral envelope compared with the smaller glycans previously observed in the crystalline state. This suggests that using the binding mode of Man(9)GlcNAc, instead of those of small glycans, may provide a platform for the design of DC-SIGNR inhibitors selective for high mannose glycans (like those on HIV). (15)N relaxation measurements provided the first information on the dynamics of the carbohydrate recognition domain, demonstrating that it is a highly flexible domain that undergoes ligand-induced conformational and dynamic changes that may explain the ability of DC-SIGNR to accommodate a range of glycans on viral surfaces.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The recently emerged highly virulent variants of porcine epidemic and diarrhea virus (PEDV) remain a huge threat to the worldwide swine industry. Here, we describe the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reverse genetics system for PEDV based on two recent Chinese field isolates, namely CHM2013 and BJ2011C. Phylogenetically, CHM2013 is closely related to the vaccine strain SM98 whereas the isolate BJ2011C belongs to the GIIb group, a cluster that contains many recent pandemic strains. The full-length cDNA clones of the two isolates were constructed into BAC under the control of CMV promoter. The rescued viruses rBJ2011C and rCHM2013 were found to replicate at the kinetics similar to their respective parental viruses in cell culture. When tested in the 2-day-old pig model, rBJ2011C caused severe diarrhea of piglets with extensive damages to the intestinal epithelium, leading to 100% fatality within 48 hours. In contrast, the rCHM2013-inoculated piglets all survived with only very minor tissue damage observed. Thus, we have successfully established a convenient platform for PEDV genome manipulation. This study also represents the first description of a DNA-launched reverse genetics system for the highly virulent PEDV.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: During the COVID-19 epidemic, there have been many misconceptions concerning vertical transmission between the mother and fetus/baby, which has caused much discussion and controversy. However, there is no strong evidence to indicate that this novel coronavirus could be vertically transmitted from infected mothers to their fetuses/infants. Several easily confused concepts are clarified in this paper, including vertical transmission, intrauterine transmission, mother-to-infant transmission, intrapartum or postpartum transmission. Well-designed protocols and a disciplined research team are essential for both basic and clinical research, in order to contribute to obtaining more scientific evidence for better understanding of the characteristics of this novel coronavirus. Proper handling and disposal of the body fluids and tissue are critical for safety. We highlight the significant value of relevant research, and suggest future research directions, such as investigating the impact of COVID-19 in different trimesters. Furthermore, China has the most experience of treating pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 virus, and it would be a great service to the rest of the world, for all centers in China to collaborate to report this collective experience.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract The deregulation of cellular long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression during a human adenovirus infection was studied by deep sequencing. Expression of lncRNAs increased substantially following the progression of the infection. Among 645 significantly expressed lncRNAs, the expression of 398 was changed more than 2-fold. More than 80% of them were up-regulated and 80% of them were detected during the late phase. Based on the genomic locations of the deregulated lncRNAs in relation to known mRNAs and miRNAs, they were predicted to be involved in growth, structure, apoptosis and wound healing in the early phase, cell proliferation in the intermediate phase and protein synthesis, modification and transport in the late phase. The most significant functions of cellular RNA-binding proteins, previously shown to interact with the deregulated lncRNAs identified here, are involved in RNA splicing, nuclear export and translation events. We hypothesize that adenoviruses exploit the lncRNA network to optimize their reproduction.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: INTRODUCTION: Croup is characterised by the abrupt onset, most commonly at night, of a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction. It leads to signs of upper airway obstruction, and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children a year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe infection can, rarely, lead to pneumonia, and to respiratory failure and arrest. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with: mild croup; moderate to severe croup; and impending respiratory failure because of severe croup? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, dexamethasone (intramuscular, oral, single-dose oral, route of administration), heliox, humidification, intermittent positive pressure breathing, L-adrenaline, nebulised adrenaline (epinephrine), nebulised budesonide, nebulised short-acting beta(2) agonists, oral decongestants, oral prednisolone, oxygen, and sedatives.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins belong to a large group of proteins that is difficult to express in traditional expression systems. The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6× His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates purification, and can be efficiently cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have purified various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These purified proteins have been used to generate highly specific polyclonal antibodies. Our study suggests that the SUMO-fusion technology will be useful for enhancing expression and purification of the viral proteins for structural and functional studies as well as for therapeutic uses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, immune-augmented, and progressive viral disease of cats associated with feline coronavirus (FCoV). Viral genetic determinants specifically associated with FIPV pathogenesis have not yet been discovered. Viral gene signatures in the spike, non-structural protein 3c, and membrane of the coronavirus genome have been shown to often correlate with disease manifestation. An “in vivo mutation transition hypothesis” is widely accepted and postulates that de novo virus mutation occurs in vivo giving rise to virulence. The existence of “distinct circulating avirulent and virulent strains” is an alternative hypothesis of viral pathogenesis. It may be possible that viral dynamics from both hypotheses are at play in the occurrence of FIP. Epidemiologic data suggests that the genetic background of the cat contributes to the manifestation of FIP. Further studies exploring both viral and host genetic determinants of disease in FIP offer specific opportunities for the management of this disease.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Severe disease caused by 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1virus is characterized by the presence of hypercytokinemia. The origin of the exacerbated cytokine response is unclear. As observed previously, uncontrolled influenza virus replication could strongly influence cytokine production. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between host cytokine responses and viral levels in pandemic influenza critically ill patients. METHODS: Twenty three patients admitted to the ICU with primary viral pneumonia were included in this study. A quantitative PCR based method targeting the M1 influenza gene was developed to quantify pharyngeal viral load. In addition, by using a multiplex based assay, we systematically evaluated host cytokine responses to the viral infection at admission to the ICU. Correlation studies between cytokine levels and viral load were done by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Fifteen patients needed of intubation and ventilation, while eight did not need of mechanical ventilation during ICU hospitalization. Viral load in pharyngeal swabs was 300 fold higher in the group of patients with the worst respiratory condition at admission to the ICU. Pharyngeal viral load directly correlated with plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, the chemotactic factors MIP-1β, GM-CSF, the angiogenic mediator VEGF and also of the immuno-modulatory cytokine IL-1ra (p < 0.05). Correlation studies demonstrated also the existence of a significant positive association between the levels of these mediators, evidencing that they are simultaneously regulated in response to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Severe respiratory disease caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza virus is characterized by the existence of a direct association between viral replication and host cytokine response, revealing a potential pathogenic link with the severe disease caused by other influenza subtypes such as H5N1.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We provide a brief history of the Chinese healthcare system since 1949 as context for the current healthcare; examine the factors that led to recent efforts to reestablish community-based care in China; and identify the challenges associated with attaining a sustainable and quality community healthcare system. Methods Based on literature review and publicly available data in China, the paper will present a historical case study analysis of health policy change of CHOs in China and provide policy evaluation, and the paper provided policy suggestions. Results We find that the government's recent efforts to emphasize the significance of community healthcare services in China have started to change patterns of healthcare use, but many problems still inhibit the development of CHOs, including unsustainable governmental roles, issues of human resource inadequacy and laggard GP practice, poorly designed payment schemes, patient's trust crisis and continue to inhibit the development of community-based primary care. Conclusions Additional policy efforts to help CHOs’ development are needed. Recent government investments in public health and primary care alone are not sufficient and could not be sustainable. It will not until long-term self-sustaining mechanisms to relieve an omnipotent government are established, including competent community doctors (GP) system, supportive social insurance reimbursement, appropriate financial incentives to providers, better transparency and accountability, as well as a more regulated referral system, a legitimate, sustainable and quality community health system could be attained.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Objectives We sought to determine the overall adherence rate to the recommended travel screening protocol and to identify factors associated with nonadherence to the protocol. Methods We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of adherence to the travel screening program in an academic hospital and three affiliated community hospitals. A regression model identified patient and hospital factors associated with nonadherence. Results Of the 147,062 patients included for analysis, 93.7% (n = 137,834) had travel screenings completed. We identified several characteristics of patients that were most likely to be missed by the screening protocol—patients with low English proficiency, patients who arrive via ambulance or helicopter, and patients with more severe illness or injury based on initial triage acuity.

In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics.

      "Error parsing: Abstract In vitro interferon production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections was examined, and compared with that of 50 healthy children. Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Post-translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation are common molecular targets of conflict between viruses and their hosts. However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic ‘arms races’ with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in ‘housekeeping’ functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a >300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: The sensitivity of mice to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) varies according to strain, age, and immune status of the animals. In semisusceptible strains, mice surviving the acute phase of infection develop a chronic disease characterized by the occurrence of paralysis, virus persistence, and immunodeficiency. Persistent MHV3 infections established in vitro in YAC and RDM -4 mouse lymphoid cell lines were characterized by virus production, presence of cytoplasmic viral antigens, and cell lysis. The occurrence of cell \"crisis\" in YAC cells was manifested by a sharp increase in cell lysis and in the number of fluorescent cells and, concomitantly, by a marked decrease in virus titers. A relationship was observed among the percentage of fluorescent cells, cell lysis, and virus yield and was modulated by renewal of culture media, change in temperature, or inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis. Cell cloning and antibody treatment experiments indicated that viral transmission was performed by viral infection of newly permissive cells produced by the division of uninfected cells in the culture and not by transmission of viral information by infected dividing cells. The biological and biochemical properties of MHV3 variants derived from persistently infected YAC lymphoid cells were characterized. Thermosensitivity and thermolability of cloned viruses originating from persistently infected YAC cells, as well as parent virus suspensions, were studied. A similar heterogeneity was observed when YAC-derived cloned substrains (YAC-MHV3) were compared with parent-derived cloned viruses, indicating that no selection of temperature-sensitive mutants was induced in persistently infected YAC cells. However, the capacity of MHV3 to induce a lethal acute disease when injected into susceptible mice was lost very rapidly. The absence of pathogenicity was related to the induction of a subclinical infection which elicited defense mechanisms. These data suggest, therefore, that MHV3 replication in lymphoid cell lines leads to induction or selection of variants which maintain pathogenicity in vitro but display reduced pathogenic effects in vivo.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as ≥1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in ≥1 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08–2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35–4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was ≤2 weeks for all viruses and detections of ≥3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

However, the role of these TAM subsets in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. Here we investigated the expression and function of TAM subsets in OSCC, especially in cancer cell proliferation. Biopsy sample from 44 patients with OSCC were examined for the expression of TAM markers and EGF by immunohistochemistry. EGF production of TAM subsets isolated from OSCC patients was assessed by flow cytometry. We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from TAM subsets on the proliferation of OSCC cells. CD163(+) cells were detected diffusely all over the tumor and connective tissue area, while CD204(+) and CD206(+) cells were mainly detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis found that CD206(+) TAMs strongly produced EGF compared with CD163(+) and CD204(+) TAMs. Cell proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells cultured with conditioned medium of CD206(+) TAMs were strongly enhanced and inhibited by anti-EGFR. The number of CD206(+) TAMs positively correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Our results revealed differences in localization and EGF production among these TAM subsets. CD206(+) TAMs might play a critical role in the proliferation of OSCC via EGF production.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of TRAF molecules in inflammation with an emphasis on available human evidence and direct in vivo evidence of mouse models that demonstrate the contribution of TRAF molecules in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated factor (TRAF) family of cytoplasmic proteins was initially identified as signaling adaptors that bind directly to the intracellular domains of receptors of the TNF-R superfamily. It is now appreciated that TRAF molecules are widely employed in signaling by a variety of adaptive and innate immune receptors as well as cytokine receptors. TRAF-dependent signaling pathways typically lead to the activation of nuclear factor-κBs (NF-κBs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). Most of these signaling pathways have been linked to inflammation, and therefore TRAF molecules were expected to regulate inflammation and inflammatory responses since their discovery in 1990s. However, direct in vivo evidence of TRAFs in inflammation and especially in inflammatory diseases had been lacking for many years, partly due to the difficulty imposed by early lethality of TRAF2(−/−), TRAF3(−/−), and TRAF6(−/−) mice. With the creation of conditional knockout and lineage-specific transgenic mice of different TRAF molecules, our understanding about TRAFs in inflammation and inflammatory responses has rapidly advanced during the past decade. SUMMARY: Increasing evidence indicates that TRAF molecules are versatile and indispensable regulators of inflammation and inflammatory responses and that aberrant expression or function of TRAFs contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Although bats are important reservoirs of diverse viruses that can cause human epidemics, little is known about the presence of picornaviruses in these flying mammals. Among 1,108 bats of 18 species studied, three novel picornaviruses (groups 1, 2, and 3) were identified from alimentary specimens of 12 bats from five species and four genera. Two complete genomes, each from the three picornaviruses, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they fell into three distinct clusters in the Picornaviridae family, with low homologies to known picornaviruses, especially in leader and 2A proteins. Moreover, group 1 and 2 viruses are more closely related to each other than to group 3 viruses, which exhibit genome features distinct from those of the former two virus groups. In particular, the group 3 virus genome contains the shortest leader protein within Picornaviridae, a putative type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′-untranslated region instead of the type IV IRES found in group 1 and 2 viruses, one instead of two GXCG motifs in 2A, an L→V substitution in the DDLXQ motif in 2C helicase, and a conserved GXH motif in 3C protease. Group 1 and 2 viruses are unique among picornaviruses in having AMH instead of the GXH motif in 3C(pro). These findings suggest that the three picornaviruses belong to two novel genera in the Picornaviridae family. This report describes the discovery and complete genome analysis of three picornaviruses in bats, and their presence in diverse bat genera/species suggests the ability to cross the species barrier.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Dicer-substrate siRNAs equipped with CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides overcome the major hurdle in cell-specific siRNA delivery. The CpG-siRNA molecules are actively internalized by TLR9(+) cells, without the need for transfection reagents, leading to RNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CpG-siRNA processing in target cells. We show that shortly after uptake into early endosomes (EE), CpG and siRNA parts of the conjugate are uncoupled in the presence of Dicer endonuclease. Diced siRNA molecules are translocated from endosomes to endoplasmic reticulum, where they can interact with the RNA interference machinery. We previously observed that even though TLR9 is not involved in CpG-siRNA uptake, it is indispensable for induction of gene silencing. To explain the role of TLR9 in intracellular processing of CpG-siRNA, we used primary macrophages derived from wild-type and Tlr9-deficient mice. Macrophages lacking TLR9 showed extended endosomal colocalization of CpG and siRNA parts of the conjugate. However, Tlr9 ablation did not interfere with the interaction of CpG-siRNA with Dicer as shown by in situ proximity ligation assay. Using CpG-siRNA labeled with pH-sensitive dye, we finally identified that lack of TLR9 in macrophages resulted in significant retention of the siRNA in endosomes. Thus, TLR9 facilitates the critical step following CpG-siRNA uncoupling, which is cytoplasmic release of the diced siRNA. These findings suggest that the class of immunostimulatory siRNAs may benefit from activation of certain endosomal immune receptors, such as TLR9, in augmented gene silencing and therapeutic efficacy.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Engaging the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) for killing of virus-infected cells and secretion of antiviral cytokines and chemokines was incorporated as one of the important features in the design of universal influenza vaccines. However, investigation of the ADCC epitopes on the highly immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin (HA) head region has been rarely reported. In this study, we determined the ADCC and antiviral activities of two putative ADCC epitopes, designated E1 and E2, on the HA head of a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in vitro and in a lethal mouse model. Our data demonstrated that sera from the E1-vaccinated mice could induce high ADCC activities. Importantly, the induction of ADCC response modestly decreased viral load in the lungs of H1N1-infected mice. However, the elevated ADCC significantly increased mouse alveolar damage and mortality than that of the PBS-vaccinated group (P < 0.0001). The phenotype was potentially due to an exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration triggered by ADCC, as an upregulated release of cytotoxic granules (perforin) was observed in the lung tissue of E1-vaccinated mice after H1N1 influenza virus challenge. Overall, our data suggested that ADCC elicited by certain domains of HA head region might have a detrimental rather than protective effect during influenza virus infection. Thus, future design of universal influenza vaccine shall strike a balance between the induction of protective immunity and potential side effects of ADCC.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: PURPOSE: Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). The aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 132 patients over a period of 2 years. The etiology of the respiratory infection was studied by conventional sputum, paired serology tests for atypical bacteria, and viral diagnostic techniques (immunochromatography, immunofluorescence, cell culture, and molecular biology techniques). We grouped the patients into four groups based on the pathogens isolated (bacterial versus. viral, known etiology versus unknown etiology) and compared the groups. RESULTS: A pathogen was identified in 48 patients. The pathogen was identified through sputum culture in 34 patients, seroconversion in three patients, and a positive result from viral techniques in 14 patients. No significant differences in identifying etiology were observed in the clinical and analytical parameters within the different groups. The most cost-effective tests were the sputum test and the polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, clinical and analytical parameters are not useful for the etiological identification of COPD exacerbations. Diagnosing COPD exacerbation is difficult, with the conventional sputum test for bacterial etiology and molecular biology techniques for viral etiology providing the most profitability. Further studies are necessary to identify respiratory syndromes or analytical parameters that can be used to identify the etiology of new AE-COPD cases without the laborious diagnostic techniques.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Microglia, unique myeloid cells residing in the brain parenchyma, represent the first line of immune defense within the central nervous system. In addition to their immune functions, microglial cells play an important role in other cerebral processes, including the regulation of synaptic architecture and neurogenesis. Chronic microglial activation is regarded as detrimental, and it is considered a pathogenic mechanism common to several neurological disorders. Microglial activation and function have been extensively studied in rodent experimental models, whereas the characterization of human cells has been limited due to the restricted availability of primary sources of human microglia. To overcome this problem, human immortalized microglial cell lines have been developed. The human microglial clone 3 cell line, HMC3, was established in 1995, through SV40-dependent immortalization of human embryonic microglial cells. It has been recently authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC®) and distributed under the name of HMC3 (ATCC®CRL-3304). The HMC3 cells have been used in six research studies, two of which also indicated by ATCC® as reference articles. However, a more accurate literature revision suggests that clone 3 was initially distributed under the name of CHME3. In this regard, several studies have been published, thus contributing to a more extensive characterization of this cell line. Remarkably, the same cell line has been used in different laboratories with other denominations, i.e., CHME-5 cells and C13-NJ cells. In view of the fact that “being now authenticated by ATCC®” may imply a wider distribution of the cells, we aimed at reviewing data obtained with the human microglia cell line clone 3, making the readers aware of this complicated nomenclature. In addition, we also included original data, generated in our laboratory with the HMC3 (ATCC®CRL-3304) cells, providing information on the current state of the culture together with supplementary details on the culturing procedures to obtain and maintain viable cells.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire an envelope by budding through the lipid bilayer of the Golgi complex. The budding compartment is thought to be determined by the accumulation of the two heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the Golgi. We recently mapped the retention signal for Golgi localization in one Bunyaviridae member (Uukuniemi virus) to the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We now show that a myc-tagged 81-residue G1 tail peptide expressed in BHK21 cells is efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and retained there during a 3-h chase. Green-fluorescence protein tagged at either end with this peptide or with a C-terminally truncated 60-residue G1 tail peptide was also efficiently targeted to the Golgi. The 81-residue peptide colocalized with mannosidase II (a medial Golgi marker) and partially with p58 (an intermediate compartment marker) and TGN38 (a trans-Golgi marker). In addition, the 81-residue tail peptide induced the formation of brefeldin A-resistant vacuoles that did not costain with markers for other membrane compartments. Removal of the first 10 N-terminal residues had no effect on the Golgi localization but abolished the vacuolar staining. The shortest peptide still able to become targeted to the Golgi encompassed residues 10 to 40. Subcellular fractionation showed that the 81-residue tail peptide was associated with microsomal membranes. Removal of the two palmitylation sites from the tail peptide did not affect Golgi localization and had only a minor effect on the association with microsomal membranes. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that Golgi retention of the heterodimeric G1-G2 spike protein complex of Uukuniemi virus is mediated by a short region in the cytoplasmic tail of the G1 glycoprotein.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic paramyxoviruses capable of causing severe disease in humans and animals. These viruses require biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment. Like other paramyxoviruses, the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can be used to detect antibodies to the surface glycoproteins, fusion (F) and attachment (G), and PRNT titers give an indication of protective immunity. Unfortunately, for NiV and HeV, the PRNT must be performed in BSL-4 containment and takes 5–7 days to complete. Thus, we have developed a neutralization assay using VSV pseudotype particles expressing the F and G proteins of NiV (pVSV-NiV-F/G) as target antigens. This rapid assay, which can be performed at BSL-2, was evaluated using serum samples from outbreak investigations and more than 300 serum samples from an experimental NiV vaccination study in swine. The results of the neutralization assays with pVSV-NiV-F/G as antigen showed a good correlation with those of standard PRNT. Therefore, this new method has the potential to be a rapid and cost-effective diagnostic method, especially in locations that lack high containment facilities, and will provide a valuable tool for basic research and vaccine development.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne infectious diseases pose a severe threat to public health in many areas of the world. Current methods for pathogen detection and surveillance are usually dependent on prior knowledge of the etiologic agents involved. Hence, efficient approaches are required for screening wild mosquito populations to detect known and unknown pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we explored the use of Next Generation Sequencing to identify viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. We extracted total RNA from different mosquito species from South China. Small 18–30 bp length RNA molecules were purified, reverse-transcribed into cDNA and sequenced using Illumina GAIIx instrumentation. Bioinformatic analyses to identify putative viral agents were conducted and the results confirmed by PCR. We identified a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus in the wild-caught Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes. The majority of the viral transcripts (.>80% of the region) were covered by the small viral RNAs, with a few peaks of very high coverage obtained. The +/− strand sequence ratio of the small RNAs was approximately 7∶1, indicating that the molecules were mainly derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The small viral RNAs overlapped, enabling contig assembly of the viral genome sequence. We identified some small RNAs in the reverse repeat regions of the viral 5′- and 3′ -untranslated regions where no transcripts were expected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNA is feasible for identifying viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. Our results show that it is possible to detect DNA viruses by sequencing the small RNAs obtained from insects, although the underlying mechanism of small viral RNA biogenesis is unclear. Our data and those of other researchers show that high throughput small RNA sequencing can be used for pathogen surveillance in wild mosquito vectors.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have a long history of safe exploitation by humans, being used for centuries in food production and preservation and as probiotic agents to promote human health. Interestingly, some species of these Gram-positive bacteria, which are generally recognized as safe organisms by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are able to survive through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), being capable to reach and colonize the intestine, where they play an important role. Besides, during the last decades, an important effort has been done for the development of tools to use LAB as microbial cell factories for the production of proteins of interest. Given the need to develop effective strategies for the delivery of prophylactic and therapeutic molecules, LAB have appeared as an appealing option for the oral, intranasal and vaginal delivery of such molecules. So far, these genetically modified organisms have been successfully used as vehicles for delivering functional proteins to mucosal tissues in the treatment of many different pathologies including GIT related pathologies, diabetes, cancer and viral infections, among others. Interestingly, the administration of such microorganisms would suppose a significant decrease in the production cost of the treatments agents since being live organisms, such vectors would be able to autonomously amplify and produce and deliver the protein of interest. In this context, this review aims to provide an overview of the use of LAB engineered as a promising alternative as well as a safety delivery platform of recombinant proteins for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

Previously we have demonstrated that PDCoV infection suppresses the production of interferon-beta (IFN-β), while the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) of PDCoV, the 3C-like protease, significantly inhibits Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN-β production by targeting the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), confirmed by the diminished function of NEMO cleaved by PDCoV. The PDCoV nsp5 cleavage site in the NEMO protein was identified as glutamine 231, and was identical to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nsp5 cleavage site, revealing the likelihood of a common target in NEMO for coronaviruses. Furthermore, this cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate the IFN response and downstream signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal PDCoV nsp5 to be a newly identified IFN antagonist and enhance the understanding of immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) require all Member States to build and maintain the capacities to prevent, detect and respond to public health emergencies. Early detection of public health risks is one of the core functions. In order to improve surveillance and detection, a better understanding of the health system conditions and their influencing factors are needed. The Israeli Ministry of Health/IHR National Focal Point held a workshop to elucidate health system conditions and their influencing factors that enable earlier detection. The workshop methodology employed a stepwise, small working group analysis approach to elucidate the conditions and their influencing factors affecting each stage of recognition, assessment, and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, at the local, regional and national levels. In order to detect public health risks earlier, the detection process needs to be moved closer to the local communities and start with building capacity within communities. Building capacity and engaging with local and diverse communities requires significant changes in the governance approach and include information sharing, multi-sectoral communication and coordination across various levels before, during and after public health emergencies. Across the regions, low-, mid- and high-income countries seem to struggle more with governance and information sharing rather than with technical capacities and capabilities.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We aimed to build a mathematical model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China. Methods: In this retrospective, outside-China diagnosis number reported from Jan 21 to Feb 28, 2020 was downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple regression model on these numbers: log10 (Nt+34)=0.0515*t+2.075 where Nt is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, t=1 at Feb 1. Findings: Based on this model, we estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Both antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) using ethanol-based disinfectants (EBDs) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important means of infection control to prevent seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) outbreaks. However, previous reports suggest a reduced efficacy of ethanol disinfection against pathogens in mucus. We aimed to elucidate the situations and mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of EBDs against IAV in infectious mucus. We evaluated IAV inactivation and ethanol concentration change using IAV-infected patients’ mucus (sputum). Additionally, AHR and AHW effectiveness against infectious mucus adhering to the hands and fingers was evaluated in 10 volunteers. Our clinical study showed that EBD effectiveness against IAV in mucus was extremely reduced compared to IAV in saline. IAV in mucus remained active despite 120 s of AHR; however, IAV in saline was completely inactivated within 30 s. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the time required for the ethanol concentration to reach an IAV inactivation level and thus for EBDs to completely inactivate IAV was approximately eight times longer in mucus than in saline. On the other hand, AHR inactivated IAV in mucus within 30 s when the mucus dried completely because the hydrogel characteristics were lost. Additionally, AHW rapidly inactivated IAV. Until infectious mucus has completely dried, infectious IAV can remain on the hands and fingers, even after appropriate AHR using EBD, thereby increasing the risk of IAV transmission. We clarified the ineffectiveness of EBD use against IAV in infectious mucus. IMPORTANCE Antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important to prevent the spread of influenza A virus (IAV). This study elucidated the situations/mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of AHR against infectious mucus derived from IAV-infected individuals and indicated the weaknesses of the current hand hygiene regimens. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the efficacy of AHR using ethanol-based disinfectant against mucus is greatly reduced until infectious mucus adhering to the hands/fingers has completely dried. If there is insufficient time before treating the next patient (i.e., if the infectious mucus is not completely dry), medical staff should be aware that effectiveness of AHR is reduced. Since AHW is effective against both dry and nondry infectious mucus, AHW should be adopted to compensate for these weaknesses of AHR.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
      "Error parsing: Three dog shelters in Rio Grande do Sul were investigated for associations between the occurrence of respiratory viruses and shelter environmental conditions. Nasal secretions randomly collected during the cold season were tested via PCR, and this data collection was followed by nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons. In shelter #1 (poor sanitary and nutritional conditions, high animal density and constant contact between dogs), 78% (58/74) of the nasal samples were positive, 35% (26/74) of which were in single infections and 44% (32/74) of which were in coinfections. Shelters #2 and #3 had satisfactory sanitary and nutritional conditions, outdoors exercise areas (#2) and animal clustering by groups (#3). In shelter #2, 9% (3/35) of the samples were positive for Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), and 6% (2/35) were positive for Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1). In shelter #3, 9% (7/77) of the samples were positive for Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2), and 1% (1/77) were positive for Canine distemper virus (CDV). The amplicon sequences (CPIV and CDV nucleoprotein gene; CAdV-2 E3 gene; CaHV-1 glycoprotein B gene) showed 94–100% nucleotide identity with GenBank sequences. Our results demonstrate that CPIV, CAdV-2 and CDV are common in dog shelters and that their frequencies appear to be related with environmental and nutritional conditions. These results indicate the need for control/prevention measures, including vaccination and environmental management, to minimize these infections and improve dog health.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

Participants in the treatment condition underwent a 7-week group based CBP, which addressed various HIV-related issues. Relevant cognitive and behavioral strategies were taught as well. The aim of treatment was to improve the quality of life and to reduce psychological distress in a sample of heterosexual symptomatic HIV-infected men. Prior to intervention, baseline measures showed that our sample had a lower quality of life in comparison with the local general population. They also experienced a significant level of psychological distress. Following intervention, men in the CBP group demonstrated significant improvement in the mental health dimension of quality of life and a significant reduction in depressed mood. These preliminary findings suggested that short-term cognitive-behavioral therapy can be effective in improving the quality of life and mood of Chinese heterosexual HIV-infected men.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n"

      "Error parsing: Abstract Objectives The aim of the study was to determine rates of mask-wearing, of respiratory infection and the factors associated with mask-wearing and of respiratory infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Beijing during the winter of 2007/2008. Methods We conducted a survey of 400 HCWs working in eight hospitals in Beijing by face to face interview using a standardized questionnaire. Results We found that 280/400 (70.0%) of HCWs were compliant with mask-wearing while in contact with patients. Respiratory infection occurred in 238/400 (59.5%) subjects from November, 2007 through February, 2008. Respiratory infection was higher among females (odds ratio [OR], 2.00 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.16-3.49]) and staff working in larger hospitals (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.09-2.72]), but was lower among subjects with seasonal influenza vaccination (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.76]), wearing medical masks (reference: cotton-yarn; OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39-0.91]) or with good mask-wearing adherence (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.98]). The risk of respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas was similar to that of HCWs in high risk area. Conclusion Our data suggest that female HCWs and staffs working in larger hospitals are the focus of prevention and control of respiratory infection in Beijing hospitals. Mask-wearing and seasonal influenza vaccination are protective for respiratory infection in HCWs; the protective efficacy of medical masks is better than that of cotton yarn ones; respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas should also be given attention.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

We investigated the feasibility of combining an online chain recruitment method (respondent-driven detection) and participatory surveillance panels to collect previously undetected information on infectious diseases via social networks of participants. Methods. In 2014, volunteers from 2 large panels in the Netherlands were invited to complete a survey focusing on symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections and to invite 4 individuals they had met in the preceding 2 weeks to take part in the study. We compared sociodemographic characteristics among panel participants, individuals who volunteered for our survey, and individuals recruited via respondent-driven detection. Results. Starting from 1015 panel members, the survey spread through all provinces of the Netherlands and all age groups in 83 days. A total of 433 individuals completed the survey via peer recruitment. Participants who reported symptoms were 6.1% (95% confidence interval = 5.4, 6.9) more likely to invite contact persons than were participants who did not report symptoms. Participants with symptoms invited more symptomatic recruits to take part than did participants without symptoms. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that online respondent-driven detection can enhance identification of symptomatic patients by making use of individuals’ local social networks.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Abstract Background: Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon (IFN) by leukocyte cultures were previously suggested to be associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Pitkäranta et al. (1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: This paper is devoted to studying the impact of human behavior on cholera infection. We start with a cholera ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that incorporates human behavior via modeling disease prevalence dependent contact rates for direct and indirect transmissions and infectious host shedding. Local and global dynamics of the model are analyzed with respect to the basic reproduction number. We then extend the ODE model to a reaction-convection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) model that accounts for the movement of both human hosts and bacteria. Particularly, we investigate the cholera spreading speed by analyzing the traveling wave solutions of the PDE model, and disease threshold dynamics by numerically evaluating the basic reproduction number of the PDE model. Our results show that human behavior can reduce (a) the endemic and epidemic levels, (b) cholera spreading speeds and (c) the risk of infection (characterized by the basic reproduction number).: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Covalent post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like factors has emerged as a general mechanism to regulate myriad intra-cellular processes. The addition and removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from factors has recently been demonstrated as a key mechanism to modulate DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. It is thus, timely to evaluate the potential for ubiquitin pathway enzymes as DDR drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The synthetic lethal approach provides exciting opportunities for the development of targeted therapies to treat cancer: most tumours have lost critical DDR pathways, and thus rely more heavily on the remaining pathways, while normal tissues are still equipped with all DDR pathways. Here, we review key deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) involved in DDR pathways, and describe how targeting DUBs may lead to selective therapies to treat cancer patients.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in the inhibiting FcγRIIB mediate anti-inflammatory responses and influence IVIG refractoriness (IVIG-R). However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele “A” in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: DC-SIGN can potentially complement the role of FcγRIIB in the anti-inflammatory cascade involved in the IVIG response mechanism.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",

      "Error parsing: Summary The magnitude of the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an unprecedented number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human transmission events, increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host occurred during the outbreak. We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013–2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.: Msg: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\n",
